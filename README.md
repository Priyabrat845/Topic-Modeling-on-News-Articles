# Topic-Modeling-on-News-Articles

Most of the data we deal with are in unstructured form & textual data is one of the biggest example of it. Natural language processing is one of the best techniques to deal with this kind of data. Machine learning for topic modeling helps the News channels, news paper groups to save time & work efficiently.


In this project I have used the BBC news articles based on 5 major segments: 
1.  business
2.  entertainment
3.  politics
4.  sports 
5.  technology


I have developed the unsupervised Machine Learning models(Hierarchical Clustering & Latent Dirichlet Allocation)to determine the number of topics & the most important words for the documents.


The process of Machine Learning model buiding includes:
1. Data cleaning – Removal of stopwords, unwanted characters.
2. Explorator data analysis - Understanding data using different visualization methods.
3. Machine Learning modelling – Built & tested the machine learning models to do the topic modeling.
