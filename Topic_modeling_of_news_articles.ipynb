But compatriot Kenenisa Bekele\\'s record hopes were dashed when he miscounted his laps in the men\\'s 3,000m and staged his sprint finish a lap too soon. Ireland\\'s Alistair Cragg won in 7:39.89 as Bekele battled to second in 7:41.42. \"I didn\\'t want to sit back and get out-kicked,\" said Cragg. \"So I kept on the pace. The plan was to go with 500m to go no matter what, but when Bekele made the mistake that was it. The race was mine.\" Sweden\\'s Carolina Kluft, the Olympic heptathlon champion, and Slovenia\\'s Jolanda Ceplak had winning performances, too. Kluft took the long jump at 6.63m, while Ceplak easily won the women\\'s 800m in 2:01.52.\\n',\n",
              " \"2004: An Irish Athletics Year\\n\\n2004 won't be remembered as one of Irish athletics' great years.\\n\\nThe year began with that optimism which invariably and unaccountably, seems to herald an upcoming Olympiad. But come late August, a few hot days in the magnificent stadium in Athens told us of the true strength of Irish athletics - or to be more accurate, the lack of it. Sonia O'Sullivan's Olympic farewell apart, there was little to stir the emotions of Irish athletics watchers. But after the disastrous build-up to the games, we shouldn't have been surprised. At the start of the year, an O'Sullivan had been earmarked as Ireland's best medal prospect but as it turned out, walker Gillian never even made it to the start line because of injury. Less than a week before the Olympics, the sport was rocked by news that 10,000m hope Cathal Lombard had tested for the banned substance EPO. Lombard's shattering of Mark Carroll's national 10,000m record in April had already set tongues wagging but even the most cynical of observers, were surprised when he was rumbled after an Irish Sports Council sting operation. The Corkman quickly held his hands up in admission and was promptly handed a two-year ban from the sport.\\n\\nBack at pre-Olympic ranch in Greece, it must have seemed that things couldn't have got any worse but they very nearly did with walker Jamie Costin lucky to escape with his life after being involved in a car crash near Athens. Once the track and field action began in Athens, a familiar pattern of underachievement emerged although Alistair Cragg's performance in being the only athlete from a European nation to qualify for the 5,000m final did offer hope for the future. Our beloved Sonia scraped into the women's 5K final as a fastest loser and for a couple of days, the country attempted to delude itself into believing that she might be in the medal shake-up. As it happened, she went out the back door early in the final although there was nothing undignified about the way that she insisted on finishing the race over a minute behind winner Meseret Defar. It later transpired that Sonia had been suffering from a stomach bug in the 48 hours before the final although typically, the Cobhwoman played down the effects of the illness. Amazingly, she was back in action a couple of weeks later when beating a world-class field at the Flora Lite 5K road race in London and while her major championship days may be over, it's unlikely that we have seen the last of her in competition. At least Sonia managed to make it to Athens. At the start of the year, several Northern Ireland athletes had genuine hopes of qualifying for the Games but come August, an out-of-form and injured Paul Brizzel was the lone standard bearer for the province. The Ballymena man gave it a lash but his achilles problem, and a bad lane draw, meant a time of 21.00 and an early exit.\\n\\nJames McIlroy, Gareth Turnbull, Zoe Brown and Paul McKee all had to be content with watching the Athens action on their television screens. 800m hope McIlroy never got near his best during the summer and a fourth place in the British trials effectively ended his hopes of making the plane. The injury-plagued Turnbull gamely travelled round Europe in search of the 1500m qualifying mark but 3:39 was the best he could achieve, after missing several months training during the previous winter. A lingering hamstring probem and a virus wrecked McKee's Athens ambitions and both he and Turnbull deserve a slice of better fortune in 2005. Pole vaulter Brown had hoped for a vote of confidence from the British selectors after she had achieved the Athens B standard but the call never came. As the summer ended, stalwarts Catherina McKiernan and Dermot Donnelly hung up their competitive spikes. McKiernan had to candidly acknowledge that time had crept up on her after several injury-ravaged years. Donnelly and his Annadale Striders team-mates later suffered tragedy when their friend and clubman Andy Campbell was found dead at his home on 18 December. A large turnout of athletics-loving folk turned out in west Belfast to offer their respects to the Campbell family and Andy's many friends. As only death can, it put the year's athletics happenings in a sharp perspective.\\n\",\n",
              " 'Off-colour Gardener storms to win\\n\\nBritain\\'s Jason Gardener shook off an upset stomach to win the 60m at Sunday\\'s Leipzig International meeting.\\n\\nGardener clocked 6.56 seconds to equal the meeting record and finished well ahead of Germany\\'s Marc Blume, who crossed the line in 6.67 secs. The world indoor champion said: \"I got to the airport and my stomach was upset and I was vomiting. I almost went home. \"I felt a little better Sunday morning but decided I\\'d only run in the main race. Then everything went perfectly.\" Gardener, part of the Great Britain 4x100m quartet that won gold at the Athens Olympics, will now turn his attention to next weekend\\'s Norwich Union European Indoor trials in Sheffield.\\n\\n\"Given I am still off-colour I know there is plenty more in the tank and I expect to get faster in the next few weeks,\" he said. \"It\\'s just a case of chipping away as I have done in previous years and the results will come.\" Scotland\\'s Ian Mackie was also in action in Leipzig. He stepped down from his favoured 400m to 200m to finish third in 21.72 secs. Germany\\'s Alexander Kosenkow won the race in 21.07 secs with Dutchman Patrick van Balkom second in 21.58 secs. There were plenty of other senior British athletes showing their indoor form over the weekend. Promising 60m hurdler\\n\\nclocked a new UK record of 7.98 seconds at a meeting in Norway. The 24-year-old reached the mark in her heat but had to settle for joint first place with former AAA champion Diane Allahgreen in the final.\\n\\n, who broke onto the international scene at the Olympic Games last season, set an indoor personal best of 16.50m in the triple jump at a meeting in Ghent. That leap - 37cm short of Brazilian winner Jadel Gregorio\\'s effort - was good enough to qualify for the European Indoor Championships. At the same meeting,\\n\\nfinished third in 7.27 seconds in a high-class women\\'s 60m. The event was won by European medal favourite Christine Arron of France while Belgium rival Kim Gevaert was second. Britain\\'s Joice Maduaka finished fifth in 7.35. Olympic bronze heptathlon medallist\\n\\nmade a low-key return to action at an indoor meeting in Birmingham. The 28-year-old cleared 1.76m to win the high jump and threw 13.86m in the women\\'s shot put.\\n',\n",
              " 'Kenya lift Chepkemei\\'s suspension\\n\\nKenya\\'s athletics body has reversed a ban on marathon runner Susan Chepkemei after she made an official apology.\\n\\nAthletics Kenya (AK) had suspended the two-time London Marathon runner-up for failing to turn up to a cross-country team training camp in Embu. \"We have withdrawn the ban. Chepkemei has given a reason for her absence,\" said AK chief Isaiah Kiplagat. \"She explained she had a contract with the organisers of the race in Puerto Rice and we have accepted her apology.\"\\n\\nThe Kenyan coaching team will now decide whether Chepkemei can be included in the team for this month\\'s world cross country championships. The 29-year-old would be a strong contender at the event in France and is hopeful she will be granted a place in the 32-strong squad. \"I am satisfied that the whole saga has been brought to an end,\" Chepkemei said. \"I am ready and prepared to represent my country. \"I will be disappointed if I am not given a chance to compete at the world cross country championships.\" AK had insisted it was making an example of Chepkemei by banning her from competition until the end of 2005. But the organisation came under intense international and domestic pressure to reverse its decision. The 29-year-old took part in the 2002 and 2003 London Marathons and was edged out by Radcliffe in an epic New York Marathon contest last year.\\n\\nThe two-time world half-marathon silver medallist will be back to challenge Radcliffe at this year\\'s London event in April. AK also dropped its harsh stance on three-time world cross country 4km champion Edith Masai. Masai missed Kenya\\'s world cross country trials because of an ankle problem but AK insisted it would take disciplinary action unless she could prove she was really injured. \"Subject to our doctor\\'s confirmation, we have decided to clear Masai,\" added Kiplagat.\\n',\n",
              " 'Greene sets sights on world title\\n\\nMaurice Greene aims to wipe out the pain of losing his Olympic 100m title in Athens by winning a fourth World Championship crown this summer.\\n\\nHe had to settle for bronze in Greece behind fellow American Justin Gatlin and Francis Obikwelu of Portugal. \"It really hurts to look at that medal. It was my mistake. I lost because of the things I did,\" said Greene, who races in Birmingham on Friday. \"It\\'s never going to happen again. My goal - I\\'m going to win the worlds.\" Greene crossed the line just 0.02 seconds behind Gatlin, who won in 9.87 seconds in one of the closest and fastest sprints of all time. But Greene believes he lost the race and his title in the semi-finals. \"In my semi-final race, I should have won the race but I was conserving energy. \"That\\'s when Francis Obikwelu came up and I took third because I didn\\'t know he was there. \"I believe that\\'s what put me in lane seven in the final and, while I was in lane seven, I couldn\\'t feel anything in the race.\\n\\n\"I just felt like I was running all alone. \"I believe if I was in the middle of the race I would have been able to react to people that came ahead of me.\" Greene was also denied Olympic gold in the 4x100m men\\'s relay when he could not catch Britain\\'s Mark Lewis-Francis on the final leg. The Kansas star is set to go head-to-head with Lewis-Francis again at Friday\\'s Norwich Union Grand Prix. The pair contest the 60m, the distance over which Greene currently holds the world record of 6.39 seconds. He then has another indoor meeting in France before resuming training for the outdoor season and the task of recapturing his world title in Helsinki in August. Greene believes Gatlin will again prove the biggest threat to his ambitions in Finland. But he also admits he faces more than one rival for the world crown. \"There\\'s always someone else coming. I think when I was coming up I would say there was me and Ato (Boldon) in the young crowd,\" Greene said. \"Now you\\'ve got about five or six young guys coming up at the same time.\"\\n',\n",
              " 'McIlroy aiming for Madrid title\\n\\nNorthern Ireland man James McIlroy is confident he can win his first major title at this weekend\\'s Spar European Indoor Championships in Madrid.\\n\\nThe 28-year-old has been in great form in recent weeks and will go in as one of the 800 metres favourites. \"I believe after my wins abroad and in our trial race in Sheffield, I can run my race from the front, back or middle,\" said McIlroy. New coach Tony Lester has helped get McIlroy\\'s career back on track. The 28-year-old 800 metres runner has not always matched his promise with performances but believes his decision to change coaches and move base will bring the rewards. McIlroy now lives in Windsor and feels his career has been transformed by the no-nonsense leadership style of former Army sergeant Lester. Lester is better known for his work with 400m runners Roger Black and Mark Richardson in the past but under his guidance McIlroy has secured five wins this indoor season.\\n\\nMcIlroy now claims he is in his best shape since finishing fourth for Ireland at the outdoor European Championships in 1998. \"That was my last decent year,\" said McIlroy, who temporarily retired last August before returning to the sport under Lester\\'s shrewd guidance. \"Before, every race was like trying to climb Mount Everest and I now know you can\\'t do it on your own. \"Trying to succeed saw me sometimes standing half-dead and terrified on the starting line, which became a bit too much.\" McIlroy, who was compared to the likes of Sebastian Coe, Steve Cram and Steve Ovett in his younger days, is now competing without the benefit of National Lottery funding. That situation could change if he maintains his current form and repeats the world-class times he produced in the 800m and 1000m at major races in Erfurt and Stuttgart earlier this season. Russian Dmitriy Bogdanov won at the same Madrid venue last week and then claimed the European Championship race would be between himself, Dutchman Arnoud Okken and Antonio Reina of Spain but McIlroy is unfazed.\\n\\nHe admitted: \"He looked quite good in his win and fair enough everyone has the right to their own opinion. \"I never write myself off and let\\'s face it, I haven\\'t or looked like being beaten this season.\" And McIlroy, whose time of one minute 46.68seconds in Erfurt elevated him to sixth place on the UK All-Time list, is also already looking beyond Madrid. He said: \"I\\'ve been much more focused this year about my career and having such a good team around me has been very important. \"Ultimately of course, this weekend is a means to an end and that is getting prepared for the summer\\'s world championships. \"That ambition has meant that I\\'ve had only two nights out since last August. The rest of my time has seen me just concentrating on rebuilding my career.\"\\n',\n",
              " 'Collins banned in landmark case\\n\\nSprinter Michelle Collins has received an eight-year ban for doping offences after a hearing at the North American Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS).\\n\\nAmerica\\'s former world indoor 200m champion is the first athlete to be suspended without a positive drugs test or an admission of drugs use. Collins\\' ban is a result of her connection to the federal inquiry into the Balco doping scandal. The 33-year-old was found guilty of using performance-enhancing drugs. The US Anti-Doping Agency (USADA) decided to press charges against Collins in the summer. The sprinter has consistently protested her innocence but the CAS has upheld USADA\\'s findings. \"The USADA has proved, beyond a reasonable doubt, that Collins took EPO, the testosterone/epitestosterone cream and THG,\" said a CAS statement. \"Collins used these substances to enhance her performance and elude the drug testing that was available at the time.\" So far a total of 13 athletes have been sanctioned for violations involving drugs associated with the Balco doping scandal. World record holder Tim Montgomery is also facing a lifetime ban after being charged by the USADA. His hearing before the CSA has been rescheduled for June next year.\\n\\nDrug enforcement chiefs in the US have vowed to crack down on cheats. USADA chief executive officer Terry Madden said the action taken against Collins was further proof of that. \"The CAS panel\\'s decision confirms that those who violate the rules will be sanctioned as part of USADA\\'s ongoing efforts to protect the rights of the overwhelming majority of US athletes that compete drug-free,\" said Madden. The USADA has built its cases on verbal evidence given to the federal investigation into Balco rather than test results. The San Francisco-based Balco laboratory faces steroid distribution and money laundering charges. The trial is expected to open next March.\\n',\n",
              " 'Greek pair attend drugs hearing\\n\\nGreek sprinters Kostas Kenteris and Katerina Thanou have appeared before an independent tribunal which will decide if their bans should stand.\\n\\nThey were given provisional suspensions by athletics\\' ruling body the IAAF in December for failing to take drugs tests before the Athens Olympics. The pair arrived with former coach Christos Tzekos to give evidence at the Hellenic Olympic Committee\\'s offices. A decision is expected to be announced before the end of February. Whatever the ruling, all parties will have the right to appeal to the Court of Arbitration for Sport. Yiannis Papadoyiannakis, who was head of the Greek Olympic team at the Athens Games last year, also testified at the tribunal, along with other Greek sports officials and athletes. \"I believe the tribunal will reach a decision that will uphold the standing of the institution,\" said Papadoyiannakis. \"Whatever the athletes have done, we must not forget that they have offered us great moments.\" Kenteris won 200m gold at the 2000 Sydney Olympics, while Thanou won silver in the 100m.\\n\\nThey withdrew from the Athens Games last August after missing drugs tests on the eve of the opening ceremony. The pair spent four days in a hospital, claiming they had been injured in a motorcycle crash. The five-member tribunal, assembled by the Hellenic Association of Amateur Athletics, is also examining allegations that Kenteris and Thanou avoided tests in Tel Aviv and Chicago before the Games. Tzekos was also banned for two years by the IAAF. He faces charges of assisting in the use of prohibited substances and tampering with the doping inspection process. All three, who have repeatedly denied the allegations, have also been charged by a Greek prosecutor and face trial for doping-related charges. A trial date has not been set. In imposing two-year suspensions on the duo on 22 December, the IAAF described their explanations for missing the tests as \"unacceptable\". But Kenteris\\' lawyer Gregory Ioannidis told BBC Sport earlier this week he was confident the sprinters would be cleared of the charges of failing to give information on their location and refusing to submit to testing. \"We refute both charges as unsubstantiated and illogical,\" he said. \"There have been certain breaches in the correct application of the rules on behalf of the sporting authorities and their officials, and these procedural breaches have also violated my client\\'s rights. \"There is also evidence that proves the fact that my client has been persecuted.\"\\n',\n",

British team member Hayley Yelling said the team would understand if Radcliffe opted out of the event. \"It would be fantastic to have Paula in the team,\" said the European cross-country champion. \"But you have to remember that athletics is basically an individual sport and anything achieved for the team is a bonus. \"She is not messing us around.

It added that Kenteris and Thanou had been \"provisionally suspended pending the resolution of their cases\". They face two-year bans if found guilty by the Greek Athletics Federation. The suspension also covers the athletes\\' controversial coach, Christos Tzekos. Kenteris, the 2000 Olympic 200m champion, and Thanou, the women\\'s 100m silver medallist from the same Games in Sydney, also face a criminal hearing in Greece over the missed tests. They failed to appear to give samples in Chicago and Tel Aviv shortly before the Athens Games and again in Athens on 12 August, the eve of the opening ceremony. Greek prosecutors have also charged them with faking a midnight motorcycle crash which led to them spending four days in hospital. Some medical staff have been charged with writing false medical reports. Wednesday\\'s statement said the Greek Federation (SEGAS) would convene a disciplinary hearing for the trio to determine whether there had been doping violations.\\n\\n\"There will be a final right of appeal from the decision of the Greek Federation to the Court of Arbitration for Sport,\" the IAAF said.

              " 'Athens memories soar above lows\\n\\nWell, it\\'s goodbye to another Olympic year and as usual there were plenty of highs and lows in Athens.\\n\\nObviously, there\\'s no getting away from the differing fortunes of Kelly Holmes and Paula Radcliffe. But I want to remind you of a few more events that made 2004 another year to remember - or forget - for athletics. \\n\\n \\n\\nOne of my favourite Olympic moments was Kelly\\'s success in the 800m.\\n\\nWinning that race was the key to her success because if she won that then the 1500m would be a bit of a formality. Kelly had been full of \"should I, shouldn\\'t I?\" thoughts about going for the double in Athens. I thought why wouldn\\'t you do the 800m, it\\'s your best event? It was such good fun to commentate on her 1500m and it was nice to be able to be part of her Athens story. \\n\\n \\n\\nThe victory for the British men\\'s 4x100m relay team was a bit of a surprise but a great climax to the Games. I think the four of them - Jason Gardener, Darren Campbell, Marlon Devonish and Mark Lewis-Francis - knew deep down that it was their best chance of a medal. The lads had run poorly in the individual sprints so maybe they did lift their game when they knew something was really at stake. \\n\\n \\n\\nHicham El Guerrouj\\'s Olympic double is a much bigger achievement than Kelly\\'s on a global scale.\\n\\nHe was the first man since for 80 years to win both the 1500m and 5,000m titles. As soon as he had added the 5,000m crown and I had finished commentating, I jumped up, ran down the stairs, pushed everyone out the way and just gave him a big hug. He is one of the few African runners who has embraced the tradition of the mile and he loves to hear all the Roger Bannister stories. Hicham is someone I enjoy having a bit of time with, even though my French and his English are not very good. \\n\\n \\n\\nWhat happened to Paula in Athens this year is the obvious low on a personal level and for the expectations of the nation as well. There were a set of circumstances around Athens that conspired to produce a very dramatic ending which I think has been greatly misunderstood. Dropping out of the marathon was the right thing to do but starting in the 10,000m five days later was not wise. That was her heart and not her head reacting. Paula had a lot of little things going wrong in her preparation and on the day.\\n\\nThings like niggling injuries, not being able to do all her running sessions and feeling the pressure of the race looming ahead of her. I think she came to the start line in Athens physically and emotionally drained. And if even the smallest thing doesn\\'t feel right when you are preparing to race a marathon, 10 miles down the road it will hit you like a brick wall. The positive thing to take from Paula\\'s Olympics it that she will have learned a lot from it and so will a lot of people - including me. \\n\\n \\n\\nPurely as a race, Paula\\'s victory in the New York Marathon has to go down as one of the most thrilling. It was so nip-and-tuck between her and Kenya\\'s Susan Chepkemei and you don\\'t usually get that kind of excitement in marathons. It was also a real delight for all athletics fans because, to use one of my favourite words, Paula showed real \"bouncebackability\". And it was a bit of a rarity for me too because I genuinely did not have an inkling how the race was going to pan out. \\n\\n \\n\\nKelly and the 4x100m boys\\' victories papered over the cracks in the general performance of the British team. We should be concerned that we\\'re not producing enough people who are capable of reaching finals at senior level.\\n\\nThe only individual men\\'s finalist on the track was Michael East in the 1500m. I am beginning to look down and wonder where are the new breed? And that\\'s where things begin to look even gloomier for British athletics as we did not win any medals at the world junior championships in Italy. Dani Barnes came fourth in the 1500m and she was the highest finisher for Team GB. The thing is if we don\\'t have athletes getting into the finals at junior level then it really doesn\\'t look good for the Beijing Olympics and beyond. \\n\\n \\n\\nI tell you what I really enjoyed this year, Benita Johnson winning the world cross country championships back in March. In the absence of Paula, we tend to think of the event as something of an African preserve. So to have an Australian come up and deliver such a surprise was something special. \\n\\n \\n\\nTo be honest, I\\'m getting bored with all the drug scandals, especially Balco. I just wish the whole thing would come to a head so we can move on.\\n\\nHaving said that, I\\'m always pleased when drugs cheats are caught because it shows the sport is standing up to it and not turning a blind eye anymore. And one of the positive things to come out of Balco is people are starting to blow the whistle. We need more people to come forward and help the authorities kick out the cheats. As regards the case against Greek sprinters Kostas Kenteris and Katerina Thanou, well suspicions have been hanging over Kenteris for a while. The bottom line is we cannot keep letting drugs damage the sport because if we do then it stops everyone enjoying it.\\n',\n",

The 31-year-old, who won Olympic 200m silver in Sydney in 2000, said during the Games that a hamstring injury had stopped him from running at his best.\\n\\nHe was criticised at the time by former Olympic champion Michael Johnson, who cast doubt on Campbell\\'s injury claims. \"To go to Athens and finally get the gold I\\'ve been trying to get for 24 years was a big relief,\" said Campbell. \"It was a chance for me to prove that if I\\'d been fit I would have been challenging for the (individual) medals. \"Every season I go and challenge for the medals so why would last season have been any different? \"It\\'s just unfortunate that I picked up that injury just before the Olympics.\" Campbell set his 100m personal best of 10.04secs when he won the European title in Budapest in 1998.

It was hoped she would be able to return this summer, but the wound from the injury has been very slow to heal. Her coach Aston Moore told the Times: \"We\\'re not looking at any sooner than 2006, not as a triple jumper.\" Moore said Hansen may be able to return to sprinting and long jumping sooner, but there is no short-term prospect of her being involved again in her specialist event. \"There was a problem with the wound healing and it set back her rehabilitation by about two months, but that has been solved and we can push ahead now,\" he said. \"The aim is for her to get fit as an athlete - then we will start looking at sprinting and the long jump as an introduction back to the competitive arena.\" Moore said he is confident Hansen can make it back to top-level competition, though it is unclear if that will be in time for the Commonwealth Games in Melbourne next March, when she will be 34. \"It\\'s been a frustrating time for her, but it has not fazed her determination,\" he added.\\n',\n",

I am confident and optimistic,\" said Thanou. \"We presented new evidence to the committee that they were not aware of.\"\\n\\nThe athletes\\' lawyer Grigoris Ioanidis said he believed the independent disciplinary committee set up by the Greek Athletics Federation (SEGAS) would find them innocent. \"We are almost certain that the charges will be dropped,\" said Ioanidis.\\n\\n\"We believe that we have presented [a case] that the charges are unreasonable.\" Thanou, the 2000 Olympic women\\'s 100m silver medallist, and Sydney 200m champion Kenteris were suspended by the IAAF for missing three drugs tests. The third was supposed to take place on the eve of the Athens Games last August, but the pair could not be found in the athletes\\' village. They were later taken to hospital after claiming to have been involved in a motorcycle accident. Thanou\\'s coach Christos Tzekos was also suspended by the IAAF. \"We were asked [by the disciplinary committee] all kinds of questions about the night of 12 August,\" said Tzekos. \"We did not leave any gaps. As far as I am concerned there is no such issue [of refusing to be tested], and I am very optimistic.\" Tzekos, Thanou and Kenteris, who have all denied the charges, can expect a decision within a month. \"Deliberations will start after some additional documents are brought in by Thursday,\" said committee chairman Kostas Panagopoulos. \"I estimate that the final ruling will be issued by the end of February.\"\\n',\n",

They will then face a hearing in front of the Greek Federation, which will ultimately determine their fate. Their former coach Christos Tzekos has also been charged with distributing banned substances. Under IAAF rules, the athletes could receive a maximum one-year suspension. Kenteris and Thanou already face a criminal trial after being charged with avoiding a drug test on the eve of the Athens Olympics and then faking a motorcyle crash.\\n\\nNo date for the trial has yet been set and again Tzekos is also facing charges. The IAAF issued an official warning to the trio last year after they were discovered training in Qatar rather than in Crete, where they had said they would be. All athletes must inform their national federations where they are at all times, so they can be available for out-of-competition drugs tests. But Kenteris and Thanou then went on to skip tests in Tel Aviv and Chicago, when they decided to fly back to Greece early.

              " \"European medal chances improve\\n\\nWhat have the European Indoor trials told us? Well, I think we could be heading to the European Championships with half a dozen medal prospects.\\n\\nIt was good to see athletes beginning to make steps forward, to see a few new faces and there were lots of personal bests kicking around.\\n\\nThe best performance on the track for me was Sarah Claxton's win in the 60m hurdles. Running sub-eight seconds twice in a week puts her right up there and if she repeats that in Madrid she will be close to picking up a medal. But what was great about Sunday's performance was that she was under pressure to produce the goods when it counted. Diane Allahgreen has been our best hurdler for some time now and I think she was surprised to be beaten by Sarah. And knowing that she got the better of Diane in a head-to-head race will give Sarah confidence. In the men's race on Saturday, Allan Scott was right in there and there is definitely more to come from him. In fact, the men's 60m hurdles is so strong, I think the selectors will pick three hurdlers to go to Madrid.\\n\\nPhillips Idowu lit up the field events, not only with his hair, but also with his leap of 17.30m, which puts him at the top of the world rankings. I had a chat with him before the competition and he was really looking forward to getting out there. He feels he is in great shape and has some big jumps inside him - but then Phillips always has. A lot of the athletes said the runway was not very helpful, so for Phillips to jump like that is a good performance. He is such a huge talent but just needs some consistency - and if he does that then the big jumps will get even further. Across the board I thought Kelly Sotherton had a great weekend and continued to show she is developing. She picked up three personal bests in the long jump, high jump and 60m hurdles and you can't ask for more than that. Kelly will be up against Carolina Kluft in the pentathlon at the European Championships but she has every chance of a medal on the basis of what we've seen so far.\\n\\nShe has a complicated training regime where different people help her with different disciplines but it seems to be working really well. It wasn't all good news in Sheffield. I thought both the 60m races were disappointing in different ways. Jason Gardener may have won but he wasn't at his best. I chatted to him afterwards and he knows it was an off-day for him. He's there to be shot at and the other lads nearly got a big scalp out there. In the women's race, Jeanette Kwayke was hoping to run against defending champion Joice Maduaka. The pair are enjoying a bit of rivalry but Joice had to pull out with a chest infection. If she had made the final I think Jeanette would have gone a bit quicker.\\n\\nJanine Whitlock competed well in the pole vault on her return following a two-year drugs ban. But the most disappointing thing in the wider view is that she is our best pole vaulter by a long way and that shouldn't be the case. The event has moved on immensely since Janine has been away and if there was more domestic competition I think that would help her. A couple of other interesting topics to look out for are the citizenship issues surrounding Mark Findlay and Rabah Yusuf. Findlay is a Londoner who has chosen to represent Trinidad and Tobago but has never run for them so he could still compete for Great Britain. Yusuf, who came third in the 400m, is from the Sudan but is trying to gain British citizenship. He came to Britain as a high jumper but damaged his toe, started doing more running and found his talent. So we shall have to see what happens to both of them.\\n\",\n",

But I still managed to do all my marathon training.\\n\\nAll the sporting people on the capital's bid team think I'm mad to be taking part in the London Marathon. The bid chairman, Lord Coe, admitted he would never dream of running a marathon, even though he was an Olympic middle-distance runner.\\n\\nKelly Holmes, former hurdler Alan Pascoe and former sprinter Frankie Fredericks - who is now an IOC member - all wanted to know why anyone would want to run that far. You'd have thought all these athletes, who have been running for most of their lives, wouldn't think it would be that bad. But the only person who was positive about my intentions was Tanni Grey Thompson, who has won the London Marathon wheelchair race six times. Even though it was a very busy week entertaining the International Olympic Committee's (IOC) Evaluation Commission, I actually found my running schedule easier to follow. When I'm at home, I get distracted by all sorts of things but for the five days I was in London, I was in a pressurised situation, but I found it easy to relax by running.\\n\\nOn Wednesday, the presentations to the IOC team did not finish until the early evening, so I just managed to squeeze in a 45-minute run. We had an early start on Thursday because we had to visit all the Olympic sites around London, that was pretty shattering, but when we got back to the hotel, I got back on the treadmill. On Friday evening I went along to the special dinner at Buckingham Palace which was a nice occasion. I never feel guilty about eating, especially when I'm exercising. And because it was a rest day I didn't have to feel bad about missing my training either. Anyway, I managed to do another quick run on Saturday ahead of the final IOC presentations, before heading home for my daughter's birthday.\\n\\nWhen I was in London I did all of my runs on the treadmill, which isn't the same as exercising outdoors. One of the IOC's technical staff from Australia ran alongside me one day. We talked about the Sydney Olympics and that made the time go past more quickly. I do find it quite comfortable running in the gym because there is more cushioning. But when you're gearing up to running on the road you need your body to get used to that jarring feeling when your feet hit the pavement. It was good to get out on the road for my long run on Sunday. After the week I'd had I was a bit concerned I wouldn't be able to complete it. But I coped with it very well and, even though it was bitterly cold, I put in 15-and-a-half miles - only another 11 to go then.\\n\\n- This year Steve will donate all the proceeds from his London Marathon efforts to victims of the tsunami.Steve will be writing a regular column on the ups and downs of his marathon training for the BBC Sport website.He will be raising money through the Steve Redgrave Trust which supports the Association of Children's Hospices, the Children With Leukaemia charity, and the Trust's own project which aims to provide inner-city schools with rowing equipment.\\n\",\n",

Asked if there was a timescale as to what medals could be taken, Pound said: \"That is not an issue at all.\" However, under International Olympic Committee (IOC) rules, athletes can only be stripped of their medals if caught within three years of the event. Jones, who won five medals at the 2000 Olympics, denies using drugs and says she will take legal action over Conte\\'s allegations.

White failed a drugs test after winning the 100m and 200m titles at the 2003 world athletics championships. She was subsequently handed a two-year ban in May this year and has admitted taking the stimulant modafinil. At first, White claimed she took the drug to combat narcolepsy but she now takes full responsibility for her actions.\\n\\n\"My whole belief about Victor is that he was selling a product,\" White said in the LA Times. \"Whether it be a good product or a bad product, he was selling a product.\" White was introduced to Conte through her coach Remy Korchemy, who is also a defendant in the Balco case.

Six candidates were interviewed for the job, including Denise Lewis\\' coach Charles van Commenee and former British triple jumper Keith Connor. \"We\\'ve searched long and hard to ensure we have found the right person,\" said UKA chief executive David Moorcroft. \"We have thoroughly tested the candidates. I believe David will make a great leader and I have great faith in what he will achieve.\" Collins said: \"It\\'s a great challenge. Over the next few months I will spend time listening to those who already make a significant contribution to athletics and other elite sports in the UK.\" Collins, who has worked with javelin thrower Steve Backley in the past, started his career as a Royal Marine before becoming a PE teacher. He is currently professor of physical education and sport performance at Edinburgh University, where he helps competitors across many sports, including rugby, athletics, judo and football.\\n\\nHe has specialised in helping competitors fulfil their potential through psychology and has worked with the Great Britain women\\'s curling team, who won gold at the 2002 Winter Olympics. Mark Lewis-Francis sought Collins\\' advice in Athens when he was looking for inspiration before he ran the final leg of Britain\\'s surprise triumph in the 4x100m relay. Collins has played rugby at regional level, was captain of the Great Britain American Football team, and competed at national level in judo and karate. He arrives with British athletics at a crossroads. Despite Kelly Holmes\\' golden double and the success of the sprint relay squad, the GB team failed to live up to expectations in Athens. Many older competitors have retired or are coming to the end of their careers, and Britain failed to win a single medal at the world junior championships in Italy this year. Collins will not have day-to-day coaching contact with the athletes, but will be expected to make changes to the system and coaching set-up in order to secure medals at the Beijing Olympics in 2008. The appointment of a new performance director was one of the main recommendations in Sir Andrew Foster\\'s review of the sport, which was published in May. It was commissioned by UK Sport and Sport England, which wanted UK Athletics to justify funding of more than £40m from the Government following the failure to hang on to the 2005 World Championships, which are now being held in Helsinki. Van Commenee dropped out of the selection process to take on the same role with the Dutch Olympic Committee, while Connor\\'s application was rejected after an arduous interview process.

After that race and more progress in training, Holmes revealed she had decided to compete at the European Indoors before her plans were wrecked last weekend. \"On Saturday night I pulled my hamstring running the last bend on my final 200m of the night,\" said Holmes. \"I was going really, really well when I felt a massive spasm in my left leg and my hamstring blew. \"I saw the doctor here and he has said it is not serious but it\\'s frustrating missing Madrid when I knew I was in great shape.\" Holmes has now been advised by her coach Margot Jennings not to rush back into training and it is unlikely she will compete again until the summer.

Athletics to me is all about pushing the barriers and being the best you can, and I would like to see her have a go at 5m in competition. Mind you, every time she breaks the record she gets $30,000 so she can afford to be deliberate about it. World records aside, I thought it was a very encouraging evening's work for Kelly Holmes. She looked good and was very positive. Agnes Samaria, who came second, is in very good shape and is in the world's top three 800m runners this season. Yes, Samaria let Kelly get away, but there was no coming back over the last 200m as Kelly dominated the race, so beating Samaria is a bit of a benchmark for Kelly. My gut feeling is that Kelly would like to run in the European Indoor Championships, but she just hasn't convinced herself she is fit enough to do so. On the other hand, I think Jason Gardener is struggling to come near what is going to be required to win the men's 60m in Madrid. He started well in the final but still could not stay with the front-runners. Jason has a lot of experience indoors but for some reason he is struggling to maintain his pace through to the finish.\\n\\nIt would have been nice to see what Mark Lewis-Francis could have done in the final, if only he hadn't got himself disqualified. He was blatantly playing the false-start game to his advantage, but it tripped him up and made him look a bit silly. My view is you're meant to go when the gun goes and not before. And if you try to unsettle your rivals by employing the false-start tactic you have to remember not to false start yourself again. Having said that, Mark is looking in much better shape. But I haven't seen anything from Mark or Jason yet which suggests France's Ronald Pognon - who has run 6.45 seconds - will be under threat at the Europeans. From a British point of view, Sarah Claxton's victory in the 60m hurdles was the best thing to come out of the meet.\\n\\nSomething else that probably went unnoticed was Melanie Purkiss winning the women's national 400m race in a new personal best of 52.98 seconds. AAAs champion Kim Wall came second in another lifetime best so we have a very strong 4x400m squad going to the European Championships. Scotland's Lee McConnell is probably going to run too, so we have a real prospect of a medal. From an international perspective, I thought Meseret Defar was disappointing in the 3,000m, but I don't think the pace-making was great. Canadian Heather Hennigar set a fast early pace but could not maintain it and if Jo Pavey had been in last year's shape she would have given Defar a real run for her money. She had a go but just could not hang in there. We were also expecting a bit more from Bernard Lagat in the men's 1500m. But he has only just come over from the USA, so he may not be that sharp and I still think he is in great shape. As for Kenenisa Bekele, he was well beaten by Markos Geneti. But we only had half expectations for Bekele as he has been struggling this season. It was very hot in the National Indoor Arena and I felt uncomfortable in the commentary box. I think those conditions affected the distance runners and in fact Defar complained to her coach after the race that she could not get her breath properly.\\n\",\n",

Conte, whose company is at the centre of a doping investigation, made the claims in a US television programme. He and three others were indicted in February by a federal grand jury for a variety of alleged offences. In an email to the Associated Press on Wednesday, Conte said: \"I stand by everything I said\". Jones won three gold medals and two bronzes in Sydney in 2000. Her lawsuit, filed in the US District Court in San Francisco, said the sprinter had passed a lie detector test and that she \"has never taken banned performance-enhancing drugs\". Conte\\'s statements, the suit added, were \"false and malicious\". After the ABC television program earlier this month, Jones\\' lawyer Richard Nicholls said: \"Marion has steadfastly maintained her position throughout: she has never, ever used performance-enhancing drugs. \"Victor Conte is a man facing a 42-count federal indictment, while Marion Jones is one of America\\'s most decorated female athletes. Mr Conte\\'s statements have been wildly contradictory. \"Mr Conte chose to make unsubstantiated allegations on television, while Marion Jones demanded to take and then passed a lie detector examination.\\n\\n\"Mr Conte is simply not credible. We challenge him to submit to the same lie detector procedure that Marion Jones passed.\" The sport\\'s ruling body, the IAAF, is taking a cautious approach to Conte\\'s allegations but contacted the US Anti-Doping Agency. Communications director Nick Davies said the IAAF would seek to contact Conte \"for further information\". But Davies stressed it would be up to the American authorities to decide whether they will take action against Jones in light of Conte\\'s television interview and the world governing body would monitor the situation closely. \"If it is felt there is case to answer, it would be for its national governing body (USA Track and Field) to take the appropriate disciplinary action,\" he added. \"The US Anti-Doping Agency has proved itself to be very diligent in its anti-doping war. \"And I am sure, like ourselves, they will be watching the television programme with great interest.\" Jones, who is under investigation for steroid use by the US Anti-Doping Agency, has continually denied ever taking illegal substances since being investigated in the Balco scandal, although she praised a zinc supplement Conte marketed. Jones, who did not win any medals in Athens in August, has never failed a drugs test. Meanwhile, Conte, who has been charged along with three other men of distributing illegal steroids and money laundering, is due to face trial in March.\\n',\n",

Wada chairman Dick Pound said: \"I am convinced the IAAF will appeal against the decision, and we will support them. \"But if they accept the federation\\'s ruling we will go before the Court of Arbitration for Sport,\" he added. Kenteris\\'s lawyer, Gregory Ioannidis, reacted angrily to Pound\\'s comments. \"Comments like these only help to embarrass the sporting governing bodies, create a hostage situation for the IAAF and strengthen our case further,\" he told BBC Sport. Kenteris, 31, and Thanou, 30, had been charged with avoiding drugs tests in Tel Aviv, Chicago and Athens and failing to notify anti-doping officials of their whereabouts before the Olympics. They withdrew from the Athens Games after missing a drugs test at the Olympic village on 12 August.\\n\\nBut an independent tribunal ruled that the duo had not been informed that they needed to attend a drugs test in Athens.\\n\\nHowever, their former coach Christos Tzekos was banned for four years by the tribunal.

Kenteris and Thanou could be suspended for up to two years. The duo withdrew from the Olympics after missing a test but claimed they had suffered a motorcycle crash. The Greek authorities have also brought criminal charges against the sprinters for avoiding a drugs test and faking an accident. Their former coach Christos Tzekos is also facing charges and all three are awaiting a trial date.\\n\\nHowever, the IAAF will determine the sprinters' future on the track after carefully considering all the evidence. The sport's ruling body is expected to direct the Greek federation in what action it should take against the sprinters. Kenteris and Thanou can appeal against any decision at the Court of Arbitration for Sport. The sprinters both sent written explanations to the IAAF, which have been taken into account. The IAAF sent an official warning to the sprinters and coach Tzekos after they were discovered training in Qatar rather than in Crete, where they had said they would be. But Kenteris and Thanou then went on to skip tests in Tel Aviv and Chicago, when they decided to fly back to Greece early. Just before the Olympics, the pair dramatically missed another test in Athens before withdrawing from the Games. Kenteris, 31, won gold in the 200m at the Sydney Olympics in 2000, where Thanou, 29, won silver in the 100m.\\n\",\n",

              " 'What now for Kelly Holmes?\\n\\nLast April, Kelly Holmes spoke to the BBC Sport website about her loneliness, her fight to stay fit and her decision not to contest both the 800m and 1500m at the Olympics.\\n\\nIt just goes to show even the most meticulous and measured athletes cannot predict what fate has in store for them. Four months later, Holmes stormed to double Olympic gold and has since been made a Dame, won the BBC Sport Personality of the Year and written a book whilst still finding time to coach aspiring athletes. With so much time spent in the spotlight, Holmes has increasingly dropped hints that her ambition on the track has begun to wilt. And when asked about her plans for both the indoor and outdoor seasons ahead, the 34-year-old has repeatedly chosen to tick the \"don\\'t know\" box. Holmes has now pulled out of this weekend\\'s European Indoor Championships, where she was selected for both the 800m and 1500m, because of a hamstring injury. But should we be surprised if the Olympic champion over both those distances decides she just does not feel like racing anymore? \"Well, it\\'s a lot easier being the double Olympic champion, being feted by everybody, than training to be at the top in middle distance running,\" points out former Olympian and BBC pundit Steve Cram. \"You have to have a real strong desire to carry on doing it even if you\\'re very talented.\"\\n\\nHolmes\\' drive and determination have always been unquestionable - that is the reason she has battled back from a string of injuries that threatened to see her finish her career empty-handed. But alarm bells start ringing when the Kent athlete begins questioning herself. \"Will I have as much commitment, desire and energy to go through a major championship?\" Holmes asked in the New Year. \"That is what I don\\'t know.\" At 34, Holmes will also be aware that time is running out. US 400m and 200m legend Michael Johnson, a five-time Olympic gold medallist, retired shortly after his 34th birthday as did Britain\\'s double Olympic champion decathlete Daley Thompson. The physical demands of the day-to-day grind will only get harder for Holmes, who has already admitted she \"doesn\\'t like the training anymore.\" Whilst out on the circuit the allure of defeating a double Olympic champion will spur her opponents on. Holmes will not want to needlessly suffer the indignity of being beaten. Unless she is certain she has a strong chance of winning any race, she will not step onto the track. But if the Kent athlete finds the form that fuelled her ambitions last summer, there are more prizes up for grabs. The day after completing her double in Athens, the 34-year-old revealed she would still like to win her first indoors title.\\n\\nHolmes\\' wish could easily be met in Madrid before she goes on to prepare for the outdoor season where there are still scores to be settled, such as a first gold at the World Championships in Helsinki. There is just one small truth which could gnaw away at Holmes\\' motivation - the realisation that no matter how hard she trains, nothing she wins now can surpass her achievements in Athens. On the other hand, if those achievements cannot be matched shouldn\\'t they be at least shared and celebrated? \"You don\\'t get the chance very often in your career to step onto the track as the double Olympic champion,\" agreed Cram. \"You want to be able to take your bow in front of the fans because it\\'s a fantastic feeling. \"I think deep down Kelly wants to run. I think she will compete and run races on the circuits but whether or not she runs in the major championships is much less certain.\"\\n\\nAthletics fans had every reason to believe they would see the new-look Kelly Holmes tearing up the track again. After her Olympic glory she emphatically denied she planned to retire. So, why is Holmes dragging her heels about making a decision on where, when or whether to even bother competing again? \"That\\'s just Kelly,\" explains Cram. \"She\\'s always been like that. \"She enjoys people trying to guess what she is going to do next. She knows every time she makes a pronouncement now it\\'s headline news. \"Kelly has to figure out for herself what it is she wants and that will be based on athletics decisions, whether she can be competitive, if she is fit enough to put her neck on the line. \"And if she decides not to run again, no-one is going to turn round and say \\'you\\'re making the wrong decision.\\'\"\\n',\n",

An independent tribunal of the Greek Track and Field Federation will meet to decide whether to ratify the sanction. The sprint duo face charges of failing to give information on their location and refusing to submit to a drugs test. Kenteris\\' lawyer Gregory Ioannidis told BBC Sport: \"We refute both charges as unsubstantiated and illogical. \"There have been certain breaches in the correct application of the rules on behalf of the sporting authorities and their officials, and these procedural breaches have also violated my client\\'s rights. \"There is also evidence that proves the fact that my client has been persecuted.\" Ioannidis, who is a law lecturer at the University of Buckingham, added: \"One of the important rights and foundations of law and justice - that the accused should be presumed innocent unless proved otherwise - has been tarnished.\" The panel will also decide on the two-year ban imposed on the athletes\\' controversial coach Christos Tzekos by the IAAF. Kenteris, the 2000 Olympic 200m champion, and Thanou, the women\\'s 100m silver medallist from the same Games in Sydney, quit the Olympics on 18 August after failing to give samples on the eve of the opening ceremony.\\n\\nTesters could not find them at the Olympic village and the duo were later admitted to hospital after claiming to have been involved in a motorcycle accident. They also missed tests in Tel Aviv, Chicago and Athens before the Games. In imposing two-year suspensions on the duo on 22 December, the IAAF described their explanations for missing the tests as \"unacceptable\". Whatever the findings of the independent tribunal, all parties will have the right to appeal to the Court of Arbitration for Sport. The tribunal hearing will take place at the Hellenic Olympic Committee building. It will start at 1200 GMT on Saturday and is expected to finish early next week. The tribunal panel will consist of five members - president Konstantinos Panagopoulos and Panagiotis Dimakos, Haralabos Hrisanthakis, Stilianos Perakis and Ioannis Karmis. Kenteris and Thanou also face criminal charges in Greece for allegedly faking the motorcycle accident.

Holmes helped erase the gloom hanging over Team GB after their biggest medal hope, Paula Radcliffe, dropped out of the marathon and then the 10,000m. Britain's men's 4x100m relay team also did their bit by taking a shock gold. Holmes had started the year in disappointing style, falling over in the final of 1500m at the World Indoor Championships where she was favourite. Her Olympic build-up was clouded by self doubt but that proved unfounded as she overhauled rival Maria Mutola to win the 800m - her first global title. Just five days later, the 34-year-old made it double gold in the 1500m. It was the first time in 84 years a Briton has achieved the Olympic middle-distance double. While Holmes left Athens as the star of Team GB, it was Radcliffe who carried expectations before the August Games.\\n\\nThe 30-year-old marathon world record holder went into the Athens event as favourite but an exhausted Radcliffe dropped out after 23 miles in tears. Her decision to enter the 10,000m five days later also backfired as she again pulled out with eight laps remaining.\\n\\nBut Radcliffe helped put her Olympic trauma behind her with a thrilling win in November's New York Marathon. The 4x100m team grabbed some last-gasp glory for the British men's Olympic squad after a poor start to the Games.\\n\\nIt seemed as though Athens would be the first Games where the men would fail to win a medal with Michael East the only individual track finalist in the 1500m. But Darren Campell, Jason Gardener, Marlon Devonish and Mark Lewis-Francis made amends in the sprint relay. The quartet held off favourites the USA to win Britain's first relay medal since 1912 in 38.07 seconds. Gardener added the Olympic relay crown to his World Indoor title over 60m and, just like Holmes, finally lived up to his promise in 2004. Kelly Sotherton completed Team GB's athletics medal haul in Athens with a surprise bronze in the heptathlon. The 28-year-old won her first championship medal since becoming a full-time athlete in 2003.\\n\\nBut it was a different story for Britain's defending champion Denise Lewis, who withdrew on day two of the competition after some poor results. Lewis, who was troubled by injury, has ruled out retiring while Sotherton is tipped to build on her success. The Athens Olympics proved to be a landmark occasion for Steve Backley, who retired from competition after finishing fourth in the javelin. The battling 35-year-old leaves the sport with a vast medal haul including two silvers and one Olympic bronze.\\n\\nAnd Backley's departure was balanced by the return of injury-hit decathlete Dean Macey, who came fourth in Athens.\\n\\nThe continued improvement of sprinter Abi Oyepitan and long jumper Chris Tomlinson also boosted Team GB. Sadly, the 2004 Olympics did not escape the problems of drugs misuse. On the eve of the Games, Greek sprinters Kostas Kenteris and Katerina Thanou missed a drugs test and claimed to have been involved in a road crash.\\n\\nKenteris, the 200m champion in 2000, and Thanou have since been charged by the Greek authorities and await trial. At the Games, Adrian Annus (hammer), Robert Fazelas (discus) and Irina Korzhanenko (shot) were all stripped of their titles because of doping issues. Hungarian compatriots Annus and Fazelas both refused to give urine samples while Russian Korzhanenko tested positive for the steroid stanozolol.\\n\\nThe fallout from the THG scandal, which rocked the sport in 2003, continued to impact in Olympic year. Britain's 4x100m team took gold without the services of Dwain Chambers, who was handed a two-year ban in February after testing positive for steroid THG.\\n\\nAmerican Kelli White was suspended and stripped of her world 100m and 200m titles after failing a drugs test. And world 400m champion Jerome Young landed a life ban from US chiefs after a second doping offence. Russian pole vaulter Yelena Isinbayeva provided some light relief by smashing the world record seven times on her way to the World Indoor and Olympic titles. Her rivalry with compatriot Svetlana Feofanova livened up the field events. Morocco's Hicham El Guerrouj also delighted fans by racing to a historic Olympic double in the 1500m and 5,000m.\\n\\nAnd though there was no Paula Radcliffe in the London Marathon, there was plenty of drama as Kenyans Evans Rutto and Margaret Okayo took the titles. Rutto held on to win despite slipping on some cobblestones and tumbling into a barrier. Okayo also had to battle back after mistiming her tactics but clinched victory on her debut.\\n\",\n",
              " 'Trial date is set for Balco case\\n\\nA US judge has set a preliminary trial date for the Balco steroid distribution case which has rocked athletics.\\n\\nUS district court judge Susan Ilston rejected an attempt by the defence team to have the case dismissed at a pre-trial hearing in San Francisco. And she set a March date for the case of the four men accused of distributing illegal performance-enhancing drugs to elite athletes to be heard. A firm decision on whether the trial takes place is expected in January. The judge said that she may conduct hearings in January into whether federal agents illegally searched the Balco headquarters and wrongfully obtained statements from the company\\'s founder Victor Conte and its vice-president James Valente. The two men - along with personal trainer Greg Anderson and athletics coach Remy Korchemny - were all indicted earlier this year but have pleaded their innocence. The outcome of those hearings could result in some or all of the charges being dismissed. Conte said that he would be telling his side of the story on an American TV show on Friday.\\n\\n\"The world deserves to know the truth about performance-enhancing drugs,\" he said. Balco (The Bay Area Laboratory Cooperative) is the company at the centre of the scandal. The company has been accused by the United States Anti-Doping Agency (USADA) of being the source of the banned steroid THG and modafinil. The USADA claims that 10 athletes have received sanctions for testing positive for THG and modafinil. Former double world champion Kelli White and Olympic relay star Alvin Harrison have both been banned on the basis of materials discovered during the Balco investigation. Britain\\'s former European 100m champion Dwain Chambers is currently serving a two-year ban after testing positive for THG in an out-of-competition test in 2003.\\n',\n",
              " 'Radcliffe tackles marathon tasks\\n\\nPaula Radcliffe faces arguably the biggest test of her career in the New York City Marathon on Sunday.\\n\\nBack under the spotlight of public scrutiny she will attempt to erase the double disappointment of the Athens Olympics, where she failed to finish the marathon and then the 10,000m. BBC Sport examines the challenges facing Radcliffe ahead of the big race. \\n\\nThe ability to run a gruelling 26.2 miles relies largely upon an athlete\\'s belief that they can do it. Every runner will hit the wall at some stage and see written on it, \"Are you strong enough to finish?\"\\n\\nThe question could hit Radcliffe hard after she was unable to complete her last two races in high-profile and emotional circumstances. Sports psychologist Hugh Richards says the 30-year-old must draw on her past achievements to conquer a potential crisis of confidence. \"There is an old adage, \\'get straight back on the horse that threw you,\\'\" Richards told BBC Sport. \"Paula has got all those great runs in her history as well as the two upsets in Athens. \"She must not lose faith in what has already been proven is a very effective strategy for distance running. \"If she were to change her preparation and tactics that would be madness. \"She wants to start rebuilding her confidence through performance accomplishment.\" \\n\\nFor much of the watching media and public there can only be two possible outcomes in New York - win or lose. If Radcliffe crosses the line first she will have proved her critics wrong. But if she fails to triumph, she risks being labelled a has-been and her profile will suffer. And for any athlete that can have repercussions in terms of sponsorship, appearance fees as well as further self esteem issues.\\n\\n\"Athletes need to try and stay focused on their internal controls and ignore external questions,\" explains Richards, who has worked with past Olympians. \"She must not get caught up in someone else\\'s agenda.\" Radcliffe\\'s best friend and fellow distance runner Liz Yelling revealed the 30-year-old is already aware she will be exposing herself to more public scrutiny in New York. \"She just thought, \\'well, they can\\'t think any worse of me now,\\'\" Yelling told BBC Sport. \"She\\'s just doing what she wants to do and not thinking about the consequences of it.\" \\n\\nRadcliffe described her decision to enter the New York marathon as \"impulsive\" but she is certain to have a tick-list of personal goals. Her aims could be as simple as completing a race and making sure she is still enjoying running but Richards says she must avoid more emotional targets, such as redemption. \"You can\\'t change history,\" warned Richards. \"Only one person can win the marathon but lots of people can be successful. \"Paula has to figure out what sort of things will she feel satisfied achieving by the end of the race.\" \\n\\nThe course from Staten Island to Central Park is renowned as one of the toughest in the world. It is also not the kind of fast course that tends to suit Radcliffe better, with the undulating finish through the park testing the legs\\' final reserves.\\n\\nRadcliffe has never raced there before and will enter the unknown just 77 days after the Athens marathon. \"It\\'s suggested after a major marathon you take a full month off and start building up again,\" said Yelling, herself a marathon runner. \"But that is only for long-term health and fitness. \"When you finish a marathon you are still very fit and can recover quickly. So physically it is possible for Paula.\" Richards also points out conditions in New York will be more conducive to a strong physical display from Radcliffe. \"The heat stress was the primary factor that tripped her up in Athens,\" he said. \"And that just isn\\'t going to be there in New York, that\\'s been taken out of the equation.\" \\n\\n\\n\\nRadcliffe concedes she will probably learn a lot from her bad experiences in Athens in time. And Richards and Yelling agree she could turn the trauma to her advantage, starting in New York. \"How you respond to adversity is what marks you out as elite or not,\" argues Richards.\\n\\n\"One of the challenges of massive set backs is how you turn them into opportunities.\" And Yelling says: \"I think this will probably make Paula.\" \"I think it will drive her on and she\\'ll come out of it a better athlete.\"\\n',\n",

Athletics bosses are considering its reponse to the ruling, while the athletes face a trial in a Greek court. Greek prosecutors have brought spearate charges of missing the drugs test and faking a motorcycle accident. Speaking to the Greek Parliament on Tuesday, Sevastis said that the evidence sent by the International Olympic Committee and athletics governing body the IAAF was not strong enough for the Greek Association to find the sprinters guilty.\\n\\n\"We were given the task of getting the snake out if its hole but we were not given any evidence to do it with,\" he said. \"So how can you as a Greek with your hand on your heart try the athletes?\" he added. The athletes are technically free to compete while the IAAF reviews its response to the decision to clear Kenteris and Thanou. But Sevastis said: \"It does not matter if they are found guilty at the Court of Arbitration for Sport and the current decision is reversed.\"\\n',\n",

But Manchester United manager Sir Alex Ferguson hinted he may be back early. He said: \"There is a chance he could be involved at Everton but we\\'ll just have to see how he comes through training.\" The 28-year-old has been training in Holland and Ferguson said: \"Ruud comes back on Tuesday and we need to assess how far on he is. \"The training he has been doing in Holland has been perfect and I am very satisfied with it.\" Even without Van Nistelrooy, United made it 13 wins in 15 league games with a 2-0 derby victory at Manchester City on Sunday. But they will be boosted by the return of the Dutch international, who is the club\\'s top scorer this season with 12 goals. He has not played since aggravating the injury in the 3-0 win against West Brom on 27 November. Ferguson was unhappy with Van Nistelrooy for not revealing he was carrying an injury. United have also been hit by injuries to both Alan Smith and Louis Saha during Van Nistelrooy\\'s absence, meaning Wayne Rooney has sometimes had to play in a lone role up front. The teenager has responded with six goals in nine games, including the first goal against City on Sunday.\\n',\n",

Wanderers hit back through Stelios Giannakopoulos, who ended a fluid passing move with a well-struck volley. But Dyer had the last word in a game of few chances, pouncing on a loose ball after Alan Shearer\\'s shot was blocked and firing into the top corner. Neither side lacked urgency in the early stages of the game, with plenty of tackles flying in, but opportunities in front of goal were harder to come by. Bolton keeper Jussi Jaaskelainen had to make two saves in quick succession midway through the first-half - keeping out Shearer\\'s low shot and Dyer\\'s close-range header - but that was the only goalmouth action of note. And it was almost out of nothing that the Magpies took the lead on 35 minutes. Bowyer found space with a neat turn on the half-way line and striding forward picked out Carr to his right. He then continued his run and with perfect timing made his way into the box where he met Carr\\'s cross with a downward header into the far corner. Bolton had produced little going forward at this point but they responded well.\\n\\nThey were level within six minutes thanks to a smart finish from Giannakopoulos. Jay-Jay Okocha twisted and turned on the edge of the area and after a neat exchange of passes involving Kevin Davies and Gary Speed, the Greek striker found the bottom corner with a first-time strike. The Magpies were opened up again before half-time as Davies set Giannakopoulos in space and Given had to block at his near post. But the home side survived, and they should have re-taken the lead with the first meaningful attack of the second half. Fernando Hierro cynically chopped down Dyer on the edge of the area with the midfielder clean through. But the veteran defender escaped with a booking as there were other defenders nearby, and from the resultant free-kick Laurent Robert curled the ball just wide. Bolton were creating little going forward and they seemed content to frustrate the Magpies. Their strategy seemed to be working until the 69th minute. Alan Shearer\\'s snap-shot was charged down and Dyer reacted first to smash the ball past the despairing Jaaskelainen from six yards.\\n\\n- Bolton boss Sam Allardyce \"I am bitterly disappointed with the result, but I am probably more disappointed with the second-half performance. \"In the first half we had put them under a lot of pressure, and our goal matched theirs in quality. \"I thought it would lift us and that they might be tired after playing a lot of games, but unfortunately we were not up for the battle in the second half. \"We allowed them to heap too much pressure on us, and in the end we cracked.\" \\n - Newcastle boss Graeme Souness \"We deserved the win.

But Smith said: \"Bringing it back would add meaning to friendly games and that\\'s something that\\'s needed.\" The Home International series was done away with in 1984, with the traditional Scotland-England fixture continuing until 1989.

There is an ironic chuckle as he talks of his immediate thoughts after a lorry, driving on the wrong side of the road, had ploughed into his rental car. \"I was in a lot of pain and I guessed that one of my toes was broken,\" says the Waterford man. \"But I was thinking maybe with a cortisone injection you never know. \"In my back, it felt as though all the muscles had been ripped off my pelvis but I was thinking maybe we could do something with laser therapy and ultra sound and hopefully I\\'d be able to race.\" It took over 10 hours before Jamie knew with certainty that he would not be competing in his second Olympics. \"My back had been broken in two places and with one of my vertebrae, the bottom part had exploded so I\\'m fierce lucky not be paralysed. \"I\\'d fractured my big toe as well which was on the brake.\" Jamie didn\\'t finally arrive at hospital in Athens until some nine and a half hours after the accident.\\n\\n\"For the first nine hours, I had no pain killers which was ridiculous in 35 degrees heat. \"But once I got the scans and saw them it was a case of moving on and thinking:\\'OK, I\\'ve got a different set of circumstances now\\'.\" Within three days he was arriving back in Ireland by air ambulance. Doctors in Athens had wanted to operate on Jamie\\'s back immediately but he insisted on delaying any surgery until he arrived back home - something he is now very relieved about. \"The Greek doctors were going to put three or four inch titanium rods either side of my spinal cord up through my vertebrae. \"That would have fused all my lower back and I would never have been able to race again. They were really putting a lot of pressure on me to agree to the surgery. \"But when I got to the Mater in Dublin they said it was possible for it to heal totally naturally which is giving me the chance to get back into competition which is very important to me. The people at the Mater have been absolutely fantastic.\" Jamie had to wear a body cast for three and a half months after the accident and spent most of that time flat on his back.\\n\\nHe then progressed to crutches for six weeks until he was finally able to walk unaided on 10 January. \"Walking without the crutches seemed like something finally really measurable in terms of my recovery.\" Physio sessions with Johnston McEvoy in Limerick have been a vital part of his recovery. \"Johnston uses an advanced type of acupuncture and it\\'s very effective. \"Needles get put right close up to my spine. A two and a half inch needle went in yesterday and I\\'m fairly incapacitated today as a result.\" Jamie has also travelled to receive treatment at the Polish training centre in Spala where he has trained with triple Olympic champion Robert Korzeniowski over the past five years. \"I was there for over a fortnight earlier this month and underwent a fair extreme treatment called cryotherapy. \"Basically, there\\'s a small room which is cooled by liquid nitrogen to minus 160 degrees centigrade and it promotes deep healing.\"\\n\\nJamie heads to Poland again on Sunday where he will be having daily cryotherapy in addition to twice-daily physio sessions and pool-work. All these sessions are small steps on the way to what Jamie hopes will be a return to racing in 2006. \"It\\'s all about trying to get mobility in my back. Lying down for three and a half months didn\\'t really help with the strength. \"There\\'s a lot of work involved in my recovery.

He will now be subjected to the normal club discipline. \"He is a competitive player but a fair player and I know how upset he is by what has happened. However, I must say that I do still believe the Chelsea player in question did go down too easily.\" Speaking immediately after the game, Moyes said: \"I don\\'t think it was a sending-off, I have been a centre-half in my time and I would have been ashamed to have gone down as easily as that.\\n\\n\"Not in a million years would John Terry have gone down in the same way.

              " 'Parry relishes Anfield challenge\\n\\nBBC Sport reflects on the future for Liverpool after our exclusive interview with chief executive Rick Parry.\\n\\nChief executive Parry is the man at the helm as Liverpool reach the most crucial point in their recent history. Parry has to deliver a new 60,000-seat stadium in Stanley Park by 2007 amid claims of costs spiralling above £120m. He is also searching for an investment package of a size and stature that will restore Liverpool to their place at European football\\'s top table. But it is a challenge that appears to sit easily with Parry, who has forged a reputation as one of football\\'s most respected administrators since his days at the fledgling Premier League.\\n\\nLiverpool have not won the championship since 1990, a fact that causes deep discomfort inside Anfield as they attempt to muscle in on the top three of Chelsea, Manchester United and Arsenal. Throw in the small matter of warding off every top club in world football as they eye captain Steven Gerrard, and you can see Parry is a man with a lot on his plate. But in the comfort of a conference room deep inside Liverpool\\'s heartbeat - The Kop end - Parry spoke to us with brutal honesty about the crucial months ahead. He only dodged one question - when asked to reveal the name of the mystery investor currently courting Liverpool, a polite smile deflected the inquiry. But to his credit, he met everything else head on in measured tones that underscore the belief that Liverpool still mean business.\\n\\nBy business he means becoming title challengers again, and locking the pieces together that will help return the trophy to Liverpool is Parry\\'s mission. Parry has already successfully put one of those planks in place in the form of new manager Rafael Benitez. And his enthusiasm for the Spaniard\\'s personality and methods is an indication of his clear feeling that he has struck gold. Benitez\\'s early work has given Parry renewed optimism about the years ahead. But it remains a massive task at a club with a unique history and expectations. This will not come as news to Parry, a lifelong Liverpool supporter, but his quiet determination suggests he is no mood to be found wanting...\\n\\nCaptain Gerrard is central to Liverpool\\'s plans and Parry\\'s insistence that all offers will be refused is a firm statement of intent. As ever, the player will have the final say, and Parry acknowledges that, but he is determined to provide the framework and environment for Liverpool and Gerrard to flourish.\\n\\nIn terms of the search for new investment, Hawkpoint were appointed as advisors to flush out interest in March 2004. Thailand Prime Minister Thaksin Shiniwatra came and went, while the most serious statement of intent came from tycoon and lifelong fan Steve Morgan. Morgan had a succession of bids rejected, having come close in the summer only for talks to break down over potential costs for the new stadium. BBC Sport understands Morgan is still ready and willing to invest in Liverpool, and Parry has kept the door ajar despite currently seeking investment elsewhere.\\n\\nMorgan, however, has had no formal contact with Liverpool or their advisors since last December, blaming indecision at board level as he publicly withdrew his £70m offer. He was also convinced his interest was being used to lure in others, so any new approach would now have to come from Liverpool. Morgan will certainly not be making another call. So speculation continues about the new benefactor, with trails leading to the Middle East and America, but all met with an understandable veil of secrecy from Anfield.\\n\\nParry meanwhile sees the new ground as crucial to Liverpool\\'s future, but is refusing to become emotionally attached to the idea. He is determined the ground will only be built on an affordable basis and will not make future Liverpool management hostages to the new stadium. Parry will pull back the moment the figures do not stack up, but there has been a vital new development in North London that has re-shaped Liverpool\\'s thinking.\\n\\nLiverpool have publicly refused to entertain the idea of stadium sponsorship and potential naming rights - but the realism of Arsenal\\'s stunning £100m deal for their new Emirates Stadium at Ashburton has changed the landscape. Parry labelled the deal \"an eye-opener\" and admits Liverpool would be missing a trick not to explore the possibilities. He knows some traditionalist Liverpool fans will reel at any attempt to call the new stadium anything other than just \\'Anfield\\', but the maths of modern-day football decree that multi-millions for stadium and team could ease the pain.\\n\\nI would take £50m if we had no investment, but if we did, keep him. As for the stadium, if it gets us cash what difference does it make really?\\n\\n£50m for Gerrard? I don\\'t care who you are, the Directors would take the money and it is the way it should be. We cannot let that sum of money go, despite Gerrard\\'s quality.\\n\\nThrough a cleverly worded statement, the club has effectively forced Gerrard to publicly make the decision for himself, which I think is the right thing to do.\\n\\nCritical time for Liverpool with regards to Gerrard. Ideally we would want to secure his future to the club for the long term. I am hoping he doesn\\'t walk out of the club like Michael Owen did for very little cash.\\n\\n£50m realistically would allow Rafa to completely rebuild the squad, however, if we can afford to do this AND keep Gerrard we will be better for it. I would however be happy with Gerrard\\'s transfer for any fee over £35m.\\n\\nParry\\'s statements are clever in that any future Gerrard transfer cannot be construed as a lack of ambition by the club to not try and keep their best players. Upping the ante is another smart move by Parry.\\n\\nI would keep Gerrard.

              " \"Time to get tough on friendlies?\\n\\nFor an international manager, a friendly provides an important opportunity to work with your players.\\n\\nThe only problem is that the game itself can often be a farce. Some people have been saying it would be better to get the players together for the week, and do away with the 90 minutes at the end.\\n\\nI would say it's 50-50 whether you should have these games or not, and if you look at it that way you would probably say you're better not doing so. It would certainly keep club managers happy, as it would reduce the risk of players returning to domestic duty injured. But international bosses will tell you that scrapping friendlies is counterproductive because the only way for a team to get better is by playing. The more you play together, the easier it is when it comes to the crunch in games like World Cup quarter-finals against Brazil. Often in friendlies, though, a manager will play his strongest side for the first 45 minutes and then send out an entirely different one in the second half. And it's very difficult for any player to come on as substitute in a side with a few changes, let alone a whole team's worth. The debate will rage on, and I'm not sure there is a satisfactory solution. One manager who has got it right this week is Walter Smith. The new Scotland manager has decided to have a training camp instead of a friendly for his first international week since replacing Berti Vogts. It is the sort of move you would expect from Walter, who is a canny manager.\\n\\nThe players have had such a hard time recently that he is better off getting them together in a relaxed atmosphere and trying to generate some team spirit before the next World Cup qualifiers. If he had sent them out on Wednesday and they had been badly beaten, it would have done them no good whatsoever. John Toshack has his first game in charge of Wales, and it will be important for him to get a decent result against Hungary. He will have his own ideas on individuals and how to play and will probably look more at the performance, but the public wants results. It's extremely difficult to get the balance for friendlies. If you win, people forget them, but if you lose it becomes a stat that can be used against you. England's game against Holland is a good example. It looks like a good opportunity to try out players like Middlesbrough winger Stewart Downing or Crystal Palace striker Andy Johnson. But you have got to remember Sven-Goran Eriksson's side were given a lesson by Spain in the last game they played.\\n\\nThe injury problems in defence should at least give the likes of Wes Brown and Jamie Carragher a chance to impress. For the club managers, it will simply be a case of waiting at home with fingers crossed.\\n\",\n",

Richie Byrne's header gave Aberdeen a way back into the game, but Stevie Crawford restored United's lead from 18 yards before half time. The scoring was completed by Grady just after the break - a superb shot on the turn making it 4-1. Tony Bullock in the United goal was called into action for the first time with just over a quarter-of-an-hour on the clock. Noel Whelan laid the ball off to Jamie Winter on the edge of the box, but his first-time effort was gathered by the United keeper. Moments later though, the home side took the lead. Barry Robson whipped in a free kick from the right, which Stevie Crawford caught on the volley. Russell Anderson failed to deal with it and Whelan's clearance off the line landed kindly at the feet of Archibald, who poked the ball into the net. United doubled their lead after 29 minutes when Grady tapped the ball into an empty net after Robson had headed Mark Wilson's cross off the angle of post and bar. But only three minutes later Aberdeen clawed their way back into the match. A free kick from the left by Winter was met powerfully by the head of Byrne at the back post, leaving Bullock helpless.\\n\\nUnited restored their two-goal lead four minutes before the end of a highly entertaining first half. Jason Scotland played a perfectly-weighted pass into the path of the onrushing Crawford and he coolly beat Ryan Esson from 18 yards. United ended the game as a contest just two minutes after the interval. Grady received a pass from Crawford with his back to goal on the edge of the box and after taking one touch, he spun to volley the ball past the despairing dive of Esson. The home side were in complete control and it required a good stop from Esson to keep out Robson's drive after 62 minutes. The keeper denied the same player again 10 minutes later, beating away his fierce shot from the left of the penalty area. Robson saw another long-range effort tipped round the post before a cute lob was headed off the line.\\n\\nBullock, Duff, Wilson, Ritchie, Archibald, Scotland (Samuel 63), Brebner, Kerr (Cameron 87), Robson, Crawford, Grady.\\n\\nColgan, Dodds, Kenneth.\\n\\nBrebner.\\n\\nArchibald 19, Grady 29, Crawford 41, Grady 47.\\n\\nEsson, Hart, Anderson, Diamond, Byrne (Morrison 75), McNaughton, Heikkinen (Foster 27), Winter, Clark (Stewart 51), Mackie, Whelan.\\n\\nBlanchard, McGuire.\\n\\n: Anderson, Diamond.\\n\\nByrne 33.\\n\\n8,661\\n\\nK Clark\\n\",\n",
              " 'Parry firm over Gerrard\\n\\nListen to the full interview on Sport on Five and the BBC Sport website from 1900 GMT.\\n\\nBut Parry, speaking exclusively to BBC Sport, also admits Gerrard, who has been constantly linked with Chelsea, will have the final say on his future. He told BBC Five Live: \"Steven is above money. He is the future of Liverpool. \"It doesn\\'t matter if it\\'s £30m, £40m or £50m, we will not accept offers. But we are also realistic enough to know we can\\'t keep Steven against his will.\" On the subject of Liverpool\\'s finances, Parry also revealed the club is ready to explore the possibility of a sponsorship deal for its proposed new stadium.\\n\\nAnd responding to criticism from BBC Sport pundit and former Liverpool stalwart Alan Hansen, he insisted talks on new investment are ongoing, but added the door has not closed on shareholder and lifelong fan Steve Morgan. Parry joined Liverpool as chief executive in July 1998 from a similar role at the Premier League. There have been several highs and lows during his time in charge at Anfield - and he had a busy summer, overseeing the arrival of new manager Rafael Benitez and managing to hold on to Steven Gerrard.\\n\\nOn the subject of Liverpool\\'s captain and prize asset, Parry revealed Real Madrid\\n\\ndid\\n\\nask for an option on the England midfield man during negotiations for striker Fernando Morientes. He said: \"They were looking for ways of saying they got more out of the deal for Fernando Morientes, but the response to Real Madrid was the same - Steven is not for sale.\" But when asked if Gerrard would be a Liverpool player on the first day of next season, Parry said: \"I sincerely hope he will be. Steven knows my views. He knows Rafa\\'s views. \"We have re-affirmed recently to Steven that we are trying to build a team around him. We crave success as much as he does. We know he\\'s ambitious and nobody can argue with that.\\n\\n\"I think Steven would dearly love to win things with Liverpool more than he\\'d like to do anything else. \"We all want to see progress by next season. He\\'s not alone in that. There are a lot of other players who feel the same, so we all have a common aim.\" It is expected Chelsea will test Liverpool with a £30m-plus bid in the summer - but Parry claims he will be in no mood to listen. \"There have been a lot of open secrets about Steven, most of which have been complete myths. It is suggested we had a deal tied up last summer. We didn\\'t had an offer last summer,\" Parry explained. \"We had told Chelsea that as far as we were concerned he was not for sale and we didn\\'t want to sell him. In reality it didn\\'t go beyond that. \"Maybe there will be an offer in the summer. Maybe there won\\'t.\\n\\n\"Our position is we want Steven to stay, but we are also realistic enough and have enough respect for Steven - and he has enough respect for us - to know that it is his decision that will be crucial. \"You are not going to keep a player like Steven against his will. That just doesn\\'t work, but any idea we are going to accept offers for Steven and then tell him \\'by the way we\\'ve decided to sell you\\' is not on the agenda. You can forget that.\" Parry is currently in the process of finalising funding for Liverpool\\'s new stadium in Stanley Park, which is set to open in 2007. And he confessed Arsenal\\'s £100m deal with Emirates to sponsor their new ground - complete with naming rights - has given the Anfield club serious food for thought. He said: \"I have to say historically it is something I have been against, and I have been on record as saying that, but I think the size of the Arsenal deal is a real eye-opener.\\n\\n\"I would say in the past deals have been done frankly far too cheaply and it just hasn\\'t even been worth contemplating. \"But the Arsenal deal is the sort of deal that causes you to draw breath and say \\'wow - that\\'s interesting.\\' \"My personal point of view is that I would find it a hell of a lot more palatable than a shared stadium.\" Some Liverpool fans would find such a move highly controversial, but Parry countered: \"I recognise it would be an emotive issue for many supporters, but you look at the amount of money available and it could go into the team. \"If it was the right partner how strong an issue is it? Time will tell. \"I think the stadium will always be Anfield, not least because of where it is, but do we need to investigate the possibilities of sponsorship? I think it would be remiss not to. \"That\\'s not to say we have made a decision that we will go down that road, but I think it is clearly something we have to explore.\"\\n\\nOn the subject of possible new investment, Parry revealed Liverpool are still in negotiations with a mystery investor, with rumours of interest from the Middle East. That prompted the withdrawal of tycoon Steve Morgan, who got frustrated by failed bids and what he claimed was indecision by the board. He also accused Liverpool of using him as \"a stalking horse\" to attract other bids, but Parry explained: \"Steve has never been used as a stalking horse. There\\'s no need, and that is not the way we do business. \"We had discussions with Steve over the course of 2004. I think we came close to concluding a deal in the summer but it didn\\'t happen. \"Quite genuinely, the new interest did appear relatively late in the day just prior to the AGM in December, and as I have said it was of such potential magnitude, and that potential is so exciting, we felt we had to evaluate it. We are still evaluating it. \"Steve\\'s interest was taken very much on its own merits. His enthusiasm for the club is there for all to see and who knows what the next few months will hold? \"The door isn\\'t closed on anything. We had a perfectly sensible dialogue with Steve last year. \"We have a common interest in making Liverpool successful. That\\'s a dream we all share, so as far as I\\'m concerned the door is not closed.\"\\n\\nI would take £50m if we had no investment, but if we did, keep him. As for the stadium, if it gets us cash what difference does it make really?\\n\\n£50m for Gerrard? I don\\'t care who you are, the Directors would take the money and it is the way it should be. We cannot let that sum of money go, despite Gerrard\\'s quality.\\n\\nThrough a cleverly worded statement, the club has effectively forced Gerrard to publicly make the decision for himself, which I think is the right thing to do.\\n\\nCritical time for Liverpool with regards to Gerrard. Ideally we would want to secure his future to the club for the long term. I am hoping he doesn\\'t walk out of the club like Michael Owen did for very little cash.\\n\\n£50m realistically would allow Rafa to completely rebuild the squad, however, if we can afford to do this AND keep Gerrard we will be better for it. I would however be happy with Gerrard\\'s transfer for any fee over £35m.\\n\\nParry\\'s statements are clever in that any future Gerrard transfer cannot be construed as a lack of ambition by the club to not try and keep their best players. Upping the ante is another smart move by Parry.\\n\\nI would keep Gerrard. No amount of money could replace his obvious love of the club and determination to succeed.\\n\\nThe key is if Gerrard comes out and says that he is happy. Clearly, if he isn\\'t, then we would be foolish not to sell. The worrying thing is who would you buy (or who would come) pending possible non-Champions League football.\\n',\n",

No official trial date has been set but it is expected to begin in September. Balco founder Victor Conte along with James Valente, coach Remy Korchemny and trainer Greg Anderson are charged with distributing steroids to athletes.\\n\\nAnderson's clients include Barry Bonds, and several other baseball stars have been asked to appear before a congressional inquiry into steroid use in the major leagues. The Balco defence team have already lost their appeal to have the case dismissed at a pre-trial hearing in San Francisco but will still argue the case should not go to trial. The hearing in June will focus on the admissibility of evidence gathered during police raids on Balco's offices and Anderson's home. Conte and Anderson were not arrested at that point but federal agents did obtain statements from them. The defence are expected to challenge the legality of those interviews and if Ilston agrees she could could reject all the evidence from the raids. Balco has been accused by the United States Anti-Doping Agency (USADA) of being the source of the banned steroid THG and modafinil.\\n\\nFormer double world champion Kelli White and Olympic relay star Alvin Harrison have both been banned on the basis of materials discovered during the Balco investigation. Britain's former European 100m champion Dwain Chambers is currently serving a two-year ban after testing positive for THG in an out-of-competition test in 2003.

And he added: \"It felt different then last summer when I had the same injury on my other foot. \"Then I could walk already after three days but I stayed sidelined for a long period.

But the Greek Athletics Federation tribunal has overturned the bans - a decision which the IAAF can now contest at the Court of Arbitration for Sport. The pair\\'s former coach, Christos Tzekos, has been banned for four years. Kenteris, 31, and Thanou, 30, had been charged with avoiding drug tests in Tel Aviv, Chicago and Athens and failing to notify anti-doping officials of their whereabouts before the Olympics. They withdrew from the Olympics after missing a drugs test at the Olympic Village on 12 August.\\n\\nThe pair then spent four days in a hospital, claiming they had been injured in a motorcycle crash. It was the International Olympic Committee\\'s demand that the IAAF investigate the affair that led to the hearing of the Greek tribunal. The head of that tribunal, Kostas Panagopoulos, said it had not been proven that the athletes refused to take the test in Athens. \"The charge cannot be substantiated,\" he said. \"In no way was he (Kenteris) informed to appear for a doping test. The same goes for Thanou.\" Kenteris\\'s lawyer, Gregory Ioannidis, said: \"The decision means Mr Kenteris has been exonerated of highly damaging and unfounded charges which have been extremely harmful for his career.\\n\\n\"He has consistently maintained his innocence and this was substantiated by further evidence we were able to submit to the tribunal following its deliberations in January. \"This evidence shows Mr Kenteris was never asked to submit to a test by the International Olympic Committee so he could not possibly have been guilty of deliberately avoiding one.

Seven minutes later, the unfortunate Dunne hooked a volley over David James\\' head and into his own net. Steve McManaman wasted City\\'s best chance when he shot wide from three yards in the first half. In the opening 45 minutes United had looked unlikely to earn the win they needed to maintain any chance of catching Chelsea in the title race. Their approach play was more laboured than patient and they managed to fashion just one chance - a Paul Scholes header over the bar. And City seemed to be content to sit back and try and hit their rivals on the break as the game settled into a tepid pattern. Only Shaun Wright-Phillips appeared capable of interrupting the monotony, looking lively down the right and causing Gabriel Heinze problems.\\n\\nWes Brown also found Wright-Phillips to be a difficult opponent when the tricky winger embarrassed him near the touchline. Wright-Phillips\\' sublime skill and pace took him past Brown and he delivered a pin-point centre to the feet of McManaman. But the former Liverpool player demonstrated why he has never scored against United by side-footing the easy chance wide. John O\\'Shea was forced off after an earlier clash with Sylvain Distin and Cristiano Ronaldo came on to replace him. He immediately caused Ben Thatcher some discomfort and looked set to inject some much-needed pace into the United attack. Rooney was being well marshalled by Dunne - but that was all about to change. After the break, United poured forward and there was a renewed urgency about their play. And when Neville delivered a cross in a carbon copy of City\\'s best first-half chance, Rooney showed McManaman how to do it - even if he needed the help of Dunne\\'s leg. Worse was to come for Dunne, who had been having a fine match. On 75 minutes, he scored a horrible own goal when attempting to volley clear Rooney\\'s cross and United seemed home and dry. However, City did fight back and Fowler missed another great chance from close range. And United keeper Roy Carroll saved well from Kiki Musampa.

Fortune headed home after 23 minutes before Ronaldo scored when Nigel Martyn parried Paul Scholes\\' free-kick. Marcus Bent missed Everton\\'s best chance when Roy Carroll, who was later struck by a missile, saved at his feet.\\n\\nRooney\\'s return was always going to be a potential flashpoint, and he was involved in an angry exchange with a spectator even before kick-off. And Rooney\\'s every touch was met with a deafening chorus of jeers from the crowd that once idolised the 19-year-old. Everton started brightly and Fortune needed to be alert to scramble away a header from Bent near the goal-line. But that was the cue for United to take complete control with a supreme passing display on a Goodison Park pitch that was cutting up. Fortune gave United the lead after 23 minutes, rising to meet Ronaldo\\'s cross from eight yards after the Portuguese youngster had been allowed too much time and space by the hapless Gary Naysmith. United dominated without creating too many clear-cut chances, and they almost paid the price for not making the most of their domination two minutes before half-time. Mikel Arteta played a superb ball into the area but Bent, played onside by Gabriel Heintze, hesitated and Carroll plunged at his fee to save. United almost doubled their lead after 48 minutes when Ronaldo\\'s low drive from 25 yards took a deflection off Tony Hibbert, but Martyn dived to save brilliantly. And Martyn came to Everton\\'s rescue three minutes later when Rooney\\'s big moment almost arrived as he raced clean through, but once again the veteran keeper was in outstanding form. But there was nothing Martyn could do when United doubled their lead after 57 minutes as they doubled their advantage. Scholes\\' free-kick took a deflection, and Martyn could only parry the ball out for Ronaldo, who reacted first to score easily. Everton\\'s problems worsened when James McFadden limped off with an injury. And there may be further trouble ahead for Everton after goalkeeper Carroll required treatment after he was struck on the head by a missile thrown from behind the goal.

William Gallas and Damien Duff could also miss the Barcelona game. France defender Gallas and Ireland winger Duff both picked up their injuries in the closing stages of Chelsea\\'s 1-0 defeat at St James\\' Park.\\n\\nWith Bridge having gone off after Mourinho used all three substitutes, those knocks plus Carlo Cudicini\\'s red card meant Chelsea finished the game with seven able-bodied players. Cudicini would not have played against Barcelona, but had been promised a game in the Carling Cup final, although he will now miss the Cardiff showpiece through suspension. The manager is not planning to add any new names to his squad ahead of the trip to Barcelona, even though he has few options to replace Bridge at left-back.\\n\\nCelestine Babayaro left the club in January, ironically to join Newcastle, and although Gallas has deputised at left-back before, he is struggling to be fit himself. It could be that Paulo Ferreira, usually a right-back, is switched to left-back with Glen Johnson, who ended the Newcastle game in goal, playing on the right. Youngsters Ben Hudell, Joe Keenan and Sam Tillen would be options should Mourinho decide to call up a replacement, but it is unlikely he would risk an untried prospect in a Champions League tie. Bridge\\'s injury also means Mourinho, who reportedly wants to sign Ashley Cole from Arsenal, will not have a specialist, senior left-back for the run-in to the season.\\n\\n\"He (Bridge) has no chance of playing against Barcelona, probably will not play against Liverpool (in the Carling Cup final) and maybe not for the rest of the season,\" he said. \"The medical department will try to do everything to recover Gallas and Duff. We will have to wait and see, but I won\\'t cry about injuries because we will have 11 players to play on Tuesday.\" Shearer said he was unsure what caused Bridge\\'s injury. \"I don\\'t know what happened.\" he said. \"It was just a shame.

But it is believed that Glazer has substantially reduced the borrowing required for his latest move.

Blues boss Jose Mourinho was sent off for taunting Liverpool fans after the goal and he watched on television as his side went on to win the game. Drogba and Kezman scored from close range before Antonio Nunez's header made for a tense finale. It was an amazing climax which gave Mourinho his first silverware as Chelsea manager. Yet it was controversial too, after Mourinho's sending off, apparently for putting his finger to his lips to hush the Liverpool fans. There was no hushing them after the extraordinary opening in which the Reds took a stunning lead inside the first minute.\\n\\nRiise could not have connected any better with Morientes' cross as he smashed a left-foot volley past Petr Cech. The goal, the quickest-ever in a League Cup final, stunned a Blues side whose previously rock-solid confidence had been shaken by consecutive losses to Newcastle and Barcelona in the previous week. The Blues' attacking chances were limited, and Jerzy Dudek was equal to Frank Lampard's powerfully-struck drive and Drogba's low shot. Despite their frustration, Chelsea began to dominate midfield without seriously threatening to break Liverpool's well-organised defence.\\n\\nJoe Cole had a shot blocked and a promising Damien Duff break was halted by a good tackle from Djimi Traore, but the Reds reached half-time without any major scares. The Blues began the second half with more urgency and pegged Liverpool back. Nevertheless, Liverpool were living dangerously and they needed a fantastic double save from Dudek on 54 minutes, first at full stretch from Gudjohnsen's header, then to smother William Gallas' follow-up. And despite Chelsea's possession, it was Liverpool who fashioned the next clear opportunity as Luis Garcia fed Dietmar Hamann whose shot forced a superb save from Cech. And the Blues' increasingly adventurous approach saw Liverpool earn another chance on the break on 75 minutes as Paulo Ferreira denied Gerrard with a last-ditch tackle. But Gerrard was on the scoresheet minutes later - in the most unfortunate fashion - as he inadvertently deflected Ferrerira's free-kick past his own keeper and in off the post to bring Chelsea level. That prompted Mourinho's reaction which saw him sent off, but Chelsea still pressed and Duff had a chance to win the game with seven minutes remaining. Dudek saved bravely at the Irishman's feet, while Milan Baros shot wildly at the other end to ensure extra time. Drogba almost headed Chelsea in front two minutes into extra-time but the striker saw the ball rebound off the post. But seconds after the half-time interval, Drogba made no mistake, picking the ball up from Glen Johnson's long throw inside the six-yard box and sidefooting home. And Kezman appeared to have made the game safe as he netted from close range after Gudjohnsen's cross in the 110th minute. There was still drama as Nunez beat Cech to a high ball with six minutes remaining to head his side level, but despite Liverpool's desperate attacks, Chelsea clung on to win.\\n\\nDudek, Finnan, Carragher, Hyypia, Traore (Biscan 67), Luis Garcia, Gerrard, Hamann, Riise, Kewell (Nunez 56), Morientes (Baros 74).\\n\\nSubs Not Used: Pellegrino, Carson.\\n\\nHyypia, Traore, Hamann, Carragher.\\n\\nRiise 1, Nunez 113.\\n\\nCech, Paulo Ferreira, Ricardo Carvalho, Terry, Gallas (Kezman 74), Jarosik (Gudjohnsen 45), Lampard, Makelele, Cole (Johnson 81), Drogba, Duff.\\n\\nSubs Not Used: Pidgeley, Tiago.\\n\\nLampard, Kezman, Drogba, Duff.\\n\\nGerrard 79 og, Drogba 107, Kezman 112.\\n\\n78,000\\n\\nS Bennett (Kent).\\n\",\n",

The sprinter has also shed weight since winning relay gold at the Athens Games. \"Last year I was 91kg, now I am 86.9kg - hopefully my times will come down,\" he said. \"This has been brought about by eating the right foods and cutting out the snacks. It is just discipline and being more focused about what I am doing.\\n\\n\"I am still keeping up my weights work and I can see the improvement in my running.\" Despite playing his part in Britain\\'s successful 4x100m relay team, Lewis-Francis still feels the frustration of missing out on the individual 100m final at the 2004 Olympics. \"That was heartbreaking, but I had made it to the semi-final and for me, on a personal level, that was an achievement. \"I just have to be patient and build up for the next Olympics.

The British sprint quartet produced a string of faultless baton changes in the final to put pressure on the Americans.\\n\\nAnd when the USA stumbled with a poor switch between Justin Gatlin and Coby Miller at the 300m stage, Britain edged ahead going into the final bend. Then, on cue, Lewis-Francis ran a textbook final leg, holding off Maurice Greene to bring Team GB home in 38.07 seconds - just one hundredth of a second ahead of their rivals. \"Winning the gold medal was the highlight of my athletics career so far,\" said the Birchfield Harrier. \"This award is not just for me, but for all my friends, family and the people who have helped me to get to this level in my sport.\" Gardener added: \"All of us had worked very hard for a long, long time to carry off what most believed was an impossible task. \"Of course this award is very special, but for me nothing will ever take away winning an Olympic gold medal.

Conte, whose company is at the centre of a doping investigation, made the claims in a US television programme. He and three others were indicted in February by a federal grand jury for a variety of alleged offences. In an email to the Associated Press on Wednesday, Conte said: \"I stand by everything I said\". Jones won three gold medals and two bronzes in Sydney in 2000. Her lawsuit, filed in the US District Court in San Francisco, said the sprinter had passed a lie detector test and that she \"has never taken banned performance-enhancing drugs\". Conte\\'s statements, the suit added, were \"false and malicious\". After the ABC television program earlier this month, Jones\\' lawyer Richard Nicholls said: \"Marion has steadfastly maintained her position throughout: she has never, ever used performance-enhancing drugs. \"Victor Conte is a man facing a 42-count federal indictment, while Marion Jones is one of America\\'s most decorated female athletes. Mr Conte\\'s statements have been wildly contradictory. \"Mr Conte chose to make unsubstantiated allegations on television, while Marion Jones demanded to take and then passed a lie detector examination.\\n\\n\"Mr Conte is simply not credible. We challenge him to submit to the same lie detector procedure that Marion Jones passed.\" The sport\\'s ruling body, the IAAF, is taking a cautious approach to Conte\\'s allegations but contacted the US Anti-Doping Agency. Communications director Nick Davies said the IAAF would seek to contact Conte \"for further information\". But Davies stressed it would be up to the American authorities to decide whether they will take action against Jones in light of Conte\\'s television interview and the world governing body would monitor the situation closely. \"If it is felt there is case to answer, it would be for its national governing body (USA Track and Field) to take the appropriate disciplinary action,\" he added. \"The US Anti-Doping Agency has proved itself to be very diligent in its anti-doping war. \"And I am sure, like ourselves, they will be watching the television programme with great interest.\" Jones, who is under investigation for steroid use by the US Anti-Doping Agency, has continually denied ever taking illegal substances since being investigated in the Balco scandal, although she praised a zinc supplement Conte marketed. Jones, who did not win any medals in Athens in August, has never failed a drugs test. Meanwhile, Conte, who has been charged along with three other men of distributing illegal steroids and money laundering, is due to face trial in March.\\n',\n",

Alan Thompson scored from the penalty spot at the start of the second half after Shaun Maloney had been fouled. Stilian Petrov slid in a third, Varga tapped in his second and Craig Bellamy completed the rout with a fine drive. Bryn Halliwell was the busier keeper early on, saving from Bellamy, Chris Sutton and Juninho. Clyde had the ball in the net after half-an-hour through a tremendous strike from Bryson, but the referee had already blown for a foul by Petrov. From the resulting free kick, Darren Sheridan curled the ball round the Celtic wall only for the post to deny him. Back at the other end, Halliwell did well to come off his line and block Bellamy's effort to lift the ball over him. The keeper misjudged a corner that Stephane Henchoz headed wide, but a similar scenario five minutes before the break led to the opening goal. The ball was delivered from the left and Halliwell was left floundering as Varga glanced the ball into the net.\\n\\nMaloney replaced the injured Sutton at half time and he marked his first competitive appearance after a year out injured by helping his side take a two-goal lead just after the break. The young striker fired a free kick straight into the Clyde wall but as he collected the rebound, he was tripped by Bryson and Thompson converted the penalty. Sheridan and Bellamy were involved in something of a flare-up that led to both being booked after the intervention of the assistant referee. Juninho brought out another good save from Halliwell and then Petrov saw a tremendous effort come off the top of the bar. But Petrov and Juninho combined brilliantly to allow the Bulgarian to make it 3-0 on the hour mark - a quick one-two giving him the time and space to steer the ball past Halliwell from 12 yards. Varga got his second goal of the game as Celtic drove home their advantage - Thompson whipped in a corner from the right and the unmarked defender simply tapped the ball over the line from a couple of yards out. Celtic were utterly dominant by this stage and Bellamy opened his scoring account for the club after a fine move involving Aiden McGeady, Jackie McNamara and Maloney culminated in the Welshman hammering the ball into the net.

There are a lot of other players who feel the same, so we all have a common aim.\" It is expected Chelsea will test Liverpool with a £30m-plus bid in the summer - but Parry claims he will be in no mood to listen. \"There have been a lot of open secrets about Steven, most of which have been complete myths. It is suggested we had a deal tied up last summer. We didn\\'t had an offer last summer,\" Parry explained. \"We had told Chelsea that as far as we were concerned he was not for sale and we didn\\'t want to sell him. In reality it didn\\'t go beyond that. \"Maybe there will be an offer in the summer. Maybe there won\\'t.\\n\\n\"Our position is we want Steven to stay, but we are also realistic enough and have enough respect for Steven - and he has enough respect for us - to know that it is his decision that will be crucial. \"You are not going to keep a player like Steven against his will. That just doesn\\'t work, but any idea we are going to accept offers for Steven and then tell him \\'by the way we\\'ve decided to sell you\\' is not on the agenda. You can forget that.\" Parry is currently in the process of finalising funding for Liverpool\\'s new stadium in Stanley Park, which is set to open in 2007. And he confessed Arsenal\\'s £100m deal with Emirates to sponsor their new ground - complete with naming rights - has given the Anfield club serious food for thought. He said: \"I have to say historically it is something I have been against, and I have been on record as saying that, but I think the size of the Arsenal deal is a real eye-opener.\\n\\n\"I would say in the past deals have been done frankly far too cheaply and it just hasn\\'t even been worth contemplating. \"But the Arsenal deal is the sort of deal that causes you to draw breath and say \\'wow - that\\'s interesting.\\' \"My personal point of view is that I would find it a hell of a lot more palatable than a shared stadium.\" Some Liverpool fans would find such a move highly controversial, but Parry countered: \"I recognise it would be an emotive issue for many supporters, but you look at the amount of money available and it could go into the team. \"If it was the right partner how strong an issue is it? Time will tell. \"I think the stadium will always be Anfield, not least because of where it is, but do we need to investigate the possibilities of sponsorship? I think it would be remiss not to. \"That\\'s not to say we have made a decision that we will go down that road, but I think it is clearly something we have to explore.\"\\n\\nOn the subject of possible new investment, Parry revealed Liverpool are still in negotiations with a mystery investor, with rumours of interest from the Middle East. That prompted the withdrawal of tycoon Steve Morgan, who got frustrated by failed bids and what he claimed was indecision by the board. He also accused Liverpool of using him as \"a stalking horse\" to attract other bids, but Parry explained: \"Steve has never been used as a stalking horse. There\\'s no need, and that is not the way we do business. \"We had discussions with Steve over the course of 2004. I think we came close to concluding a deal in the summer but it didn\\'t happen. \"Quite genuinely, the new interest did appear relatively late in the day just prior to the AGM in December, and as I have said it was of such potential magnitude, and that potential is so exciting, we felt we had to evaluate it. We are still evaluating it. \"Steve\\'s interest was taken very much on its own merits. His enthusiasm for the club is there for all to see and who knows what the next few months will hold? \"The door isn\\'t closed on anything. We had a perfectly sensible dialogue with Steve last year. \"We have a common interest in making Liverpool successful. That\\'s a dream we all share, so as far as I\\'m concerned the door is not closed.\"\\n\\nI would take £50m if we had no investment, but if we did, keep him. As for the stadium, if it gets us cash what difference does it make really?\\n\\n£50m for Gerrard? I don\\'t care who you are, the Directors would take the money and it is the way it should be. We cannot let that sum of money go, despite Gerrard\\'s quality.\\n\\nThrough a cleverly worded statement, the club has effectively forced Gerrard to publicly make the decision for himself, which I think is the right thing to do.\\n\\nCritical time for Liverpool with regards to Gerrard. Ideally we would want to secure his future to the club for the long term. I am hoping he doesn\\'t walk out of the club like Michael Owen did for very little cash.\\n\\n£50m realistically would allow Rafa to completely rebuild the squad, however, if we can afford to do this AND keep Gerrard we will be better for it. I would however be happy with Gerrard\\'s transfer for any fee over £35m.\\n\\nParry\\'s statements are clever in that any future Gerrard transfer cannot be construed as a lack of ambition by the club to not try and keep their best players. Upping the ante is another smart move by Parry.\\n\\nI would keep Gerrard. No amount of money could replace his obvious love of the club and determination to succeed.\\n\\nThe key is if Gerrard comes out and says that he is happy. Clearly, if he isn\\'t, then we would be foolish not to sell. The worrying thing is who would you buy (or who would come) pending possible non-Champions League football.\\n',\n",
              " 'Giggs handed Wales leading role\\n\\nRyan Giggs will captain Wales as he wins his 50th cap in Wednesday\\'s friendly against Hungary in Cardiff.\\n\\nJohn Toshack, in his first game as coach after succeeding Mark Hughes, admits he is surprised that Giggs has only just reached the landmark. \"With the games he\\'s played for United, proportionately it doesn\\'t seem that many for Wales,\" Toshack said. \"But he\\'s one of the greatest of all Welsh internationals and on his 50th cap it\\'s appropriate he\\'s captain.\" Giggs admits he had briefly considered retirement from the international game, but is now targetting playing for Wales in the 2008 European Championships. The Manchester United wing revealed how club manager Sir Alex Ferguson talked him into extending his Wales career. \"I briefly discussed my international future with Sir Alex, but he urged me to carry on,\" Giggs said. \"He feels, like myself, that I have no weight problems and keep myself fit, so in three or four years\\' time I will be able to play in the European finals if we get there. \"The manager has always wanted me to play for my club and country and he was keen for me to continue because I am fit enough.\"\\n\\nGiggs admits he was wavering and considering joining the likes of former Wales skipper Gary Speed and United team-mate Paul Scholes in committing the remaining years of his career to club football. But Giggs is now focussed on making the Toshack era even more successful than the time Hughes spent at the helm. The Manchester United winger won his first cap as a 17-year-old in 1991, an away loss to Germany, and now faces his landmark appearance at the age of 31. With Giggs leading Wales out against Hungary, there is every chance that he will become the permanent successor to Speed. However, Toshack refused to reveal whether he sees Giggs as a long-term option. \"For this particular game I think it is appropriate that Ryan Giggs will be captain, it\\'s his 50th cap and he\\'s known for some time about that,\" Toshack said. On Wednesday night Toshack takes charge of his first match since replacing Hughes, and Giggs said: \"It\\'s my 50th cap and I am looking forward to it, and I hope to play a lot more times from here on in. \"It\\'s important to be here, all the players feel the same. It\\'s a new start and all the top players certainly see it as important. \"I see myself leading by example, it is something I have taken on for Wales as well as United these past few seasons. \"The way John is looking at things, he is aiming to build his side around the experienced lads right up to the next tournament, the Euro 2006 event. \"I have told John I will be around for the next European tournament, by then I will be 35 so hopefully I will still be okay. \"A lot can happen, but I\\'m hoping to be around.\" Giggs\\' own personal future at Old Trafford is still up in the air as he has yet to reach agreement on a new contract, with Manchester United offering one extra year and Giggs seeking two. \"I have put the contract thing to the back of my mind at the moment,\" said Giggs. \"It is an important period for the club and I am just concentrated on that. \"I\\'ve heard the suggestions, hopefully there is a two-year deal about to be offered because that is what I am looking for, to get it sorted out. \"I\\'m enjoying my football, the way United have been playing and my own form, you have to enjoy it. \"We have massive games coming up: Manchester City this week, then the Everton cup tie, followed by AC Milan in the Champions League, and my first Wales game under John Toshack, so it\\'s an important time.\"\\n',\n",

Ronaldino wasted a second-half chance to equalise for Barca when he put a penalty wide, but Torres made no such mistake with a last-minute spot-kick. The defeat, coupled with Real Madrid's 4-0 win over Espanyol on Saturday, reduces Barca's lead to four points. Former Everton midfielder Thomas Gravesen scored his first goal for Real in the comfortable victory at the Bernabeu. Zinedine Zidane had opened the scoring before Raul bagged a brace. Gravesen, who replaced Zidane, completed the scoring in the 84th minute with a low shot. David Beckham, watched by Sven-Goran Eriksson, came off in the 67th minute with a shoulder injury but should be fit for England's game against Holland.

McAllister himself scored the second when he met Saul Mikoliunas' cross at the back post to put the game beyond the visitors. Craig Easton headed in a controversial goal after an hour but Hearts held on. The opening goal came after Gus Bahoken had clumsily fouled Miller 35 yards from goal. McAllister floated the free kick into the Livi box and Miller outjumped the static visiting defence to loop his header from 10 yards over Meldrum. With just 10 minutes on the clock, the home side doubled their lead. Mikoliunas sprinted down the right, crossed to the back post where McAllister raced in to head past Meldrum. Moments later Miller came close to grabbing his second with a first-time drive from 16 yards, which skimmed the bar.\\n\\nThen McAllister picked up a pass from Stephen Simmons and drove an angled shot from 20 yards narrowly past Meldrum's far post. The impressive Mikoliunas twice went close before half time - a low drive was comfortably gathered by Meldrum and then he curled a left-footed shot past the keeper's right-hand post. Livi manager Richard Gough made three changes at the interval, bringing on defender Goran Stanic, midfielder Gabor Vincze, and striker Ferenc Horvath for Bahoken, Derek Lilley and Mark Wilson. But, in the opening stages of the second period, little changed. However, the West Lothian side gave themselves a lifeline with a controversial goal. Eric Deloumeaux sent Jason Dair away on the right and he tried to give the ball to McPake, who looked to be in an offside position. The Livi striker ignored the pass, however, and Dair ran on to it and played Easton in at the back post and he headed home from close range. The home side called for offside against McPake but referee Alan Freeland ignored their claims and pointed to the centre-circle. Livi went all out for the equaliser.

But Middlesbrough peppered the Charlton goal after the break and Chris Riggott stroked home the equaliser. Shaun Bartlett\\'s strike put Charlton back in front but that lead lasted just six minutes before Graham rushed onto Queudrue\\'s pass to head home. The match burst to life from the whistle and Charlton defender Hermann Hreidarsson had sight of an open goal after just six minutes. Hreidarsson received Danny Murphy\\'s free-kick from the right but he crashed his free header wide of the far post. The Iceland international looked such a danger the Boro bench could be heard issuing frantic instructions to mark him.\\n\\nCharlton\\'s early pressure paid off when Bartlett received a long ball from Talal El Karkouri in the box and laid it off to Holland who buried his right-footed strike. Szilard Nemeth, recalled in place of Joseph-Desire Job, was twice denied his chance to get Middlesbrough back on level terms by Dean Kiely. The striker played a great one-two with Jimmy Floyd Hasselbaink only to see Kiely get down well to smother his shot before directing a header straight into the keeper\\'s arms. Boro had plenty of time on the ball but the Addicks comfortably mopped up the pressure - with Kiely tipping a Hasselbaink header over the bar - to take their lead into half-time.\\n\\nIt was all one-way traffic after the break at the Riverside as Middlesbrough poured forward and Kiely even saved Hreidarsson\\'s blushes when he palmed the ball away to prevent a Charlton own goal.

The Boro defender looked suspiciously offside as he got on the end of Gareth Southgate\\'s misdirected effort, but despite the Charlton protests his goal stood.

I\\'ve never done that and I have medals for sporting merit.\" Aragones was handed the fine on Tuesday after making racist remarks about Henry to Arsenal team-mate and Spanish international Jose Reyes last October.\\n\\nThe Spanish Football Federation at first declined to take action against Aragones, but was then requested to do so by Spain\\'s anti-violence commission. The fine was far less than the expected amount of about £22,000 or even the suspension of his coaching licence. Arsenal boss Arsene Wenger, who was fined £15,000 in December for accusing Manchester United striker Ruud van Nistelrooy of cheating, believes that Aragones\\' punishment was too lenient. \"You compare his fine and my fine, and if you consider his was for racist abuse, then you seem to get away with it more in Spain than you should,\" Wenger said. \"He shouldn\\'t have said what he said, and how much money is enough, I don\\'t know but it doesn\\'t look a big punishment.\" However, Aragones insists the fine is unjustified and unfair. \"I have been treated like Islero (the bull that killed famous bullfighter Manolete),\" said Aragones on hearing he had been fined for his actions. \"I have not liked one thing about this whole affair and I do not agree with the sanction. They have looked for a scapegoat.\" Spain\\'s anti-violence commission must now ratify the Spanish FA\\'s decision and has until next week to announce its verdict.

              " \"Chelsea denied by James heroics\\n\\nA brave defensive display, led by keeper David James, helped Manchester City hold the leaders Chelsea.\\n\\nAfter a quiet opening, James denied Damien Duff, Jiri Jarosik and Mateja Kezman, while Paul Bosvelt cleared William Gallas' header off the line. Robbie Fowler should have scored for the visitors but sent his header wide. Chelsea had most of the possession in the second half but James kept out Frank Lampard's free-kick and superbly tipped the same player's volley wide. City went into the game with the proud record of being the only domestic team to beat Chelsea this season. And there was little to alarm them in the first 30 minutes as Chelsea - deprived of Arjen Robben and Didier Drogba through injury - struggled to pose much of a threat. Indeed, it was the visitors who looked likelier to enliven a drab opening played at a lethargic pace. Shaun Wright-Phillips - watched by England boss Sven-Goran Eriksson - showed his customary trickery to burst into the right of the area and deliver a dangerous ball, which was blocked by John Terry. But Chelsea suddenly stepped up a gear and created a flurry of chances. First, Duff got round Ben Thatcher and blasted in a shot that James parried to Kezman, who turned the ball wide.\\n\\nSoon afterwards, Jarosik found space in the area to powerfully head Lampard's corner goalwards but James tipped the ball over. Chelsea were now looking more like Premiership leaders and James kept out Kezman's fierce drive before Bosvelt and James combined to clear Gallas' header from Duff's corner. City broke swiftly up the field and the last chance of a frenetic spell should have resulted in Fowler celebrating his 150th Premiership goal. Wright-Phillips raced down the left and crossed to Fowler but City's lone man up front, left free by Terry's slip, contrived to head wide when it seemed a breakthrough was certain. The second half started as quietly as the first, although James was forced to divert a cross from the lively Duff away from Eidur Gudjohnsen's path. There was a nasty moment for Petr Cech, looking for a ninth straight clean sheet in the league, when a series of ricochets saw Fowler chase a loose ball in the area and collide accidently with the Czech Republic stopper. Another quiet spell followed, which Duff interrupted with a surging run that was halted illegally on the edge of the penalty area by Bosvelt.

It gives players the chance to recharge their batteries midway through the season, which some suggest will give teams an advantage in the Champions League. \"The other school of thought suggests having a break then coming back to it puts you at a disadvantage. \"The bigger discussions around the winter break should be to do with the nature of football today, the needs of football players and the way the Premiership has developed, rather than one or two matches in the Champions League in February.\" Hodgson believes a winter break carries many advantages, explaining: \"As I said, it is the perfect chance to recharge batteries.\\n\\n\"And certainly if I was still a manager in England I would be supporting any calls for its introduction. \"In pre-season you get a lot of enthusiasm and energy but by the time you get towards Christmas many players, having also played plenty of international matches for club and country and travelled a lot, find themselves getting very jaded. \"The break gives them a chance to recover that energy and enthusiasm and, perhaps more importantly, recover their mental strength during the break and get ready for the games ahead. \"The mental side is by far the most important thing.\" Hodgson added: \"The length of breaks can vary. In Italy the break was very short. You just took Christmas and New Year. \"It was so short you didn\\'t do anything. You gave the players a week or 10 days off, then you were training for a week or 10 days and then went into a game. \"If it is longer, it is important those responsible for physical fitness give the players a programme to follow to ensure the physical strength they have accumulated stays with them.\" And Hodgson believes a winter break would be a positive step in the Premiership. He said: \"If we talk about football at elite level, which the Premiership is, then I would support a winter break. \"If you examine the demands of the Premier League and, in particular on players who play international football for their club and country, then a break would do them the world of good - physically and mentally.\"\\n',\n",

Robbie Keane, skipper for the night and scorer of the crucial second goal, echoed his manager\\'s sentiments on the last-eight match. \"They\\'re on a high, but we\\'re confident and in the last few games we\\'ve played well and hopefully we can go there and get the win,\" he said.\\n\\nHe conceded the win over Forest, which included goals from Noe Pamarot and Mido, was not pretty to watch. \"It wasn\\'t the best display but it\\'s all about the result,\" the Irishman said. \"We knew it was going to be difficult with the conditions. The pitch wasn\\'t the best but we still tried to pass it. \"We dug in and the gaffer said to us at half-time to keep being patient and that the goal will come.\" Forest manager Gary Megson conceded his team did not deserve anything after a poor performance. \"If you play like we did and concede two goals from corners you\\'re going to have an uphill battle against a very good team,\" he said. \"If we defend in the Championship like we did we\\'ll not get another point. \"We were organised but I felt at times we thought the system would be enough but we didn\\'t look like scoring.\"\\n',\n",

What I have to judge is whether he will struggle with the early pace after being out for so long,\" he said. \"His ability puts him in with a big shout but it is a major decision.\" Ferguson, though, is confident his young players, particularly Wayne Rooney and Cristiano Ronaldo, are up to the task. \"We have an opportunity to win this cup this year, no question about that,\" he declared. \"With the maturity we see every week in Ronaldo and Rooney, the return of Van Nistelrooy and the form of Roy Keane, Paul Scholes and Ryan Giggs, we must have a fantastic chance.\" It is a view shared by Rooney, who believes \"if we can get past Milan, we have a great chance\". \"As soon as I knew we were playing Milan, I got excited. Looking at the draw, it is anyone\\'s trophy but we have every chance. \"Hopefully, we can get to that final in Turkey and bring the cup back to Manchester.\" Milan coach Carlo Ancelotti said his team were looking forward to returning to the venue where they lifted Europe\\'s most prestigious club title two seasons ago. Milan beat Juventus in a penalty shootout after a 0-0 tie at Old Trafford and Ancelotti said: \"We are all very happy to return (to Old Trafford) to play in the Champions League and this will give us great motivation.\" Ancelotti said he was aware of the threat United posed to his hopes of Champions League glory. \"It\\'s fundamental that we don\\'t allow them to take control of the game. Our intention is not to adapt to their play but to play our game,\" he said. \"They have great quality in attack, they use the wings a lot and we will have to make sure we stop them.\"\\n',\n",

However, he guided his side to the 1988 European Championship title with a 2-0 win over the Soviet Union in the final. Michels played for Ajax and coached the side to four national titles between 1965-71 and a European Cup in 1971. His 1970s Dutch team was built around Johan Cruyff and Johan Neeskens and introduced the concept of \\'total football\\' to the world. The strategy was to foster team coherence and individual imagination - with all players possessing the skills to play in any part of the pitch. Cruyff was the on-field organiser of a team whose players rotated in and out of defence at will and was encouraged to play creative attacking football. Michels had recently undergone heart surgery and Dutch football federation (KNVB) spokesman Frank Huizinga said: \"He was one of the best coaches we had in history.\" The no-nonsense coach also enjoyed spells at Barcelona, who he took to a Spanish title in 1974, FC Cologne and Bayer Leverkusen. Michels, named coach of the century by world football\\'s governing body Fifa in 1999, also won five caps for the Netherlands as a bruising centre forward. Dutch sports minister Clemence Ross-van Dorp said: \"He was the man who, together with Cruyff, made Dutch football big.\"\\n',\n",

Opposite number Ronald Waterreus had been Rangers' hero, saving superbly from Craig Bellamy and John Hartson. Striker Novo secured victory, lobbing Douglas with eight minutes remaining. It ended Celtic's 11-game unbeaten run at home in Old Firm derbies and gave Rangers manager Alex McLeish his first victory at the home of his Glasgow rivals. Celtic had won their last six meetings on their home pitch, including twice already this season. They started confidently, with new signing Bellamy, on loan from Newcastle United, given his Celtic debut up front with Wales international colleague John Hartson and Chris Sutton dropping into midfield. It took Bellamy just four minutes to threaten, taking on Marvin Andrews before delivering a low drive that was held by Waterreus at the second attempt. He had an even better chance after Hartson dispossesed Sotiris Kyrgiakos and sent his strike partner clear with only the goalkeeper to beat. But Waterreus did well to beat away Bellamy's disappointing low drive from 16 yards. Waterreus came to the rescue again when the ball fell to Hartson just inside the box and the Dutch goalkeeper made a brave block. It was an Old Firm return for Barry Ferguson as McLeish stuck by the side that thumped four goals past Hibernian. But Rangers found Celtic harder to break down and Douglas was not threatened until 10 minutes after the break. Dado Prso turned inside Neil Lennon only for the Celtic goalkeeper to beat away his powerful 18-yard drive. A great defensive header by Andrews prevented Hartson pouncing from five yards out. Hartson foxed Vignal at the edge of the Rangers box, but the striker's shot on the turn was again beaten away by Waterreus. Rangers were beginning to dominate the midfield and Vignal, collecting a knock back from Fernando Ricksen, broke the deadlock, Douglas somehow letting the Frenchman's dipping drive slip through his grasp. Novo pounced on a moments' hesitation in the Celtic defence to latch on to a long ball from Ricksen and lob the ball over the advancing Douglas. Ricksen appeared to be hit by a coin, but it could not prevent Rangers' celebrations at the final whistle.\\n\\n: Douglas, McNamara, Balde, Varga, Laursen, Petrov, Lennon, Sutton, Thompson, Bellamy, Hartson.\\n\\nSubs: Marshall, Henchoz, Juninho Paulista, Lambert, Maloney, Wallace, McGeady.\\n\\n: Waterreus, Hutton, Kyrgiakos, Andrews, Ball, Buffel, Ferguson, Ricksen, Vignal, Prso, Novo.\\n\\nSubs: McGregor, Namouchi, Burke, Alex Rae, Malcolm, Thompson, Lovenkrands.\\n\\n: M McCurry\\n\",\n",

Lauren, Patrick Vieira, Freddie Ljungberg and Ashley Cole scored for Arsenal, while Andy Gray and Phil Jagielka were on target for the Blades. Michael Tonge and Harley wasted chances for the underdogs, but Paddy Kenny was inspired to keep Arsenal at bay. Arsenal, stripped of attacking talent such as Thierry Henry and Dennis Bergkamp, partnered 17-year-old Italian striker Arturo Lupoli with Ljungberg up front. It was a revamped Arsenal line-up, and they were almost a goal behind within seconds as Tonge wasted a glorious chance. Gray ran free down the right flank, and his cross left Tonge with the simplest of chances, but he blazed over the top from six yards.\\n\\nArsenal were barely seen as an attacking force in the opening 45 minutes, although Ljungberg turned a half-chance wide after good work by Cesc Fabregas. Arsene Wenger introduced Quincy Owusu-Abeyie for the ineffective Lupoli at half-time, and the pacy Dutch youngster had an immediate impact. He ran clear after good work by Mathieu Flamini, but his finish was tame and Kenny saved easily. Owusu-Abeyie then fired in a testing cross, which was met by Fabregas, and it needed a desperate clearance by Kenny's legs to save the Blades. Arsenal were now totally dominant, and were desperately unlucky not to take the lead after 62 minutes when Fabregas crashed a rising drive against the bar from 20 yards. It then took a brilliant tackle by Jagielka to deny Ljungberg as he was poised to strike. Arsenal continued to press, and once again Kenny was called into action with eight minutes left, diving low to clutch another close-range effort from Fabregas. Neil Warnock's side almost snatched victory in the dying seconds when Derek Geary's cross found Harley at the far post, but his diving header was brilliantly turned over by Almunia. Owusu-Abeyie's pace was causing all sorts of problems for the Blades, and as extra-time began, another surging run into the penalty area almost set up a chance for Ljungberg. Pascal Cygan missed Arsenal's best chance after 106 minutes, blazing across the face of goal when he was unmarked at the far post. Arsenal sent on Jeremie Aliadiere with seven minutes of extra-time left, and he almost broke the deadlock with his first touch. Kolo Toure's misplaced free-kick landed at his feet, but Kenny once again blocked from a tight angle. Arsenal laid siege to Sheffield United's goal in the dying minutes, but they somehow held on to force penalties.

Scotland are not blessed with quality players with experience at the top level, so Smith will have to get the best out of meagre resources. Smith's track record make impressive reading and he is widely respected within the game. The man who was Alex Ferguson's assistant when Scotland played at the 1986 World Cup won seven league titles with Rangers. And his appointment has been widely endorsed by many of the games' top names, including Ferguson and Graeme Souness, who took him to Ibrox as his assistant in 1986. Characters like Souness, Ferguson and current Ibrox manager Alex McLeish all cite Smith's experience and his expansive knowledge of the Scottish game.\\n\\nMuch was made of Vogts' inability to express himself to the players and media. That will certainly not be the case with Smith. The former Dundee United and Dumbarton full-back is from the managerial old school - straight talking and never slow to let players know when he expects better (often with the use of some colourful invective). But it should be remembered Vogts came to Scotland with an impressive curriculum vitae - a World Cup winner as a player and a European Championships winner as a manager. Smith will inherit the same problems Vogts had - a callow squad of players with no exceptional talents. And it remains to be seen if Smith will experience the rash of call-offs that blighted so much of Vogts' preparation work. A fresh start for the Scottish national team was imperative and Smith is widely regarded as a safe pair of hands. But will a safe pair of hands be enough when the adroit hands of a magician might be required...\\n\",\n",

You try and balance out over the course of a season but I\\'ve had so many rough decisions against them you begin to wonder.\" With tensions spilling over afterwards - United boss Sir Alex Ferguson was allegedly pelted with pizza in the players\\' tunnel - there is little surprise that so much is riding on the return encounter on. \"Everyone at Arsenal has been waiting for this game,\" said Campbell. \"We are up for this one.\"\\n\\nSpeaking on his long-term plans, Campbell signalled his intent to move abroad before he turns 35. \"I\\'m 30 now and in five years\\' time I won\\'t be in this country - that\\'s definite. \"Italy looks good to me because it would suit my kind of football.

But it was being stressed to BBC Sport that Juninho would prefer to remain with the Scottish champions. Juninho wants assurances that he will return to O\\'Neill\\'s first-team plans. He has become frustrated with his lack of first-team action since his move from Middlesbrough in the summer. Hassel says Juninho, who has just bought a new home, would \"desperately like to stay at Celtic\" but will seek a move if it is made clear that he is not wanted.\\n\\nThe agent also stressed that nothing should be read into the 30-year-old\\'s father being in Scotland and talk of a move back to Botafogo in Brazil. Juninho\\'s father was simply in the country to see his son and grandchildren. \"I know there is interest from a Brazilian club, but I know Juninho doesn\\'t want to go there,\" said Hassel. \"He wants to stay in Britain. In fact, he wants to stay at Celtic.\" Hassall made it clear that a move to Manchester City, who are badly in need of a midfield play-maker, was more of a possibility than Botafogo, or Mexican outfit Red Sharks Veracruz, who also expressed an interest. \"It was a thought at one stage,\" he said. \"If you are not going to get a game under one manager, you look for another whose style of play suits you. \"He is a fan of Kevin Keegan\\'s style of play.

The 26-year-old has already handed in a transfer request at Ewood Park as he seeks a return to Ibrox.

On Thursday Rangers said they would not be increasing their offer of £4m.\\n\\nBlackburn have said all along that they want £6m for the midfielder and Williams has rejected proposals from Rangers over a player-swap deal. Williams said: \"We are in dialogue with Glasgow Rangers but we have no agreement.\" The negotiations will have to be concluded by midnight on Monday, when the winter transfer window shuts. Williams conceded any deal for Ferguson was looking \"unlikely\" before the close of the transfer window but Rangers still had a chance to seal the deal. \"We have no comment to make other than we have not got an agreement with Glasgow Rangers,\" he added. \"The way things are looking, I think it is unlikely we are going to. \"The ball is in their court but we have not got an offer that is acceptable at this moment.\" It is understood that Blackburn accepted a £5m offer for Ferguson from Everton at the weekend.

Celtic are in no position to match Birmingham\\'s £6m offer but a stay until the end of the season could suit Bellamy while he considers his future.

But what did the Spanish press make of the affair? BBC Sport looks at the reaction. \\n\\n \\n\\nThere is little coverage of the racist chanting on Wednesday night\\'s game. But AS does cover the English reaction to the pre-match comments from Spain coach Luis Aragones, who highlighted Britain\\'s colonial past when probed about his own remarks regarding Thierry Henry in October. Journalist Guillem Balague writes: \"In our country, where multi-culturalism is a new thing, we are in nappies dealing with these things, and have a naivety which makes the English nervous.\"\\n\\nMarca refers in passing to the booing of England\\'s black players - but only after referring to the cheers of \"ole\" which greeted the long periods of Spanish possession. Aragones\\' \"no comment\" to questions about racism after the match is also highlighted, as Marca focuses on the Spanish coach\\'s praise for his players. Serbia & Montenegro\\'s 2-0 World Cup qualifying win in Belgium - which could make qualification tougher for Spain - seems to be of greater importance.\\n\\nElsewhere, the Spanish media criticises its English counterparts for stoking up the racism issue. \"Were there racist chants against some players? This hasn\\'t happened in the Spanish league and Spain for many years,\" said Spanish Federation press officer Fernando Garrido. \"So you (English reporters) should ask yourselves what you have done to contribute to all this.\" And Spanish daily ABC accuses English reporters of launching a witch-hunt against Aragones. \"Perhaps it was because their team had played so poorly and they wanted to divert attention towards this muddled issue,\" the paper says. \\n\\n \\n\\n\"What the boy in the Bernabeu did was odd... Rooney seemed intent to kick any Spanish player who approached him.\" Yet Rooney is seen only as the worst example of many England miscreants, with Gary Neville criticised for continuing the feud between Manchester United and Arsenal for his tackles on Jose Reyes. Ashley Cole\\'s treatment of Joaquin, and a Frank Lampard foul on Reyes are also lambasted for their \"ugliness\".\\n\\nMarca\\'s headline says it all: \"Wayne Rooney se volvi&#243; loco en el Bernab&#233;u (Wayne Rooney became crazy in the Bernabeu)\" Rooney\\'s display alarms the writer, in particular three \"chilling\" fouls on Joaquin, Casillas and Marchena, which \"could well have left them in the infirmary.\" And like AS, Marca criticises Gary Neville for \"leaving a message on Reyes\\' ankle\" to remind him of the Manchester United-Arsenal clash this month. \\n\\n \\n\\nSpain\\'s first-half performance is showered with praise, with Xavi singled out as the biggest star. \"Xavi did things on Wednesday which were worthy of Maradona,\" the paper beams, adding, \"What a work-rate, what dynamism, what vision, what leadership, what a midfield player!\" On a controversial evening, AS offers one seemingly undeniable viewpoint: \"Spanish football players played better football than the English.\"\\n\\nMore plaudits are given to the home team, with Jaime Vargas lauding the manner in which \"Spain dominated England with order and quality\". The paper adds: \"The bad thing about Spain v England was that it lasted only 65 minutes after which a succession of changes prevented any real competition.\" Vargas does not mention England\\'s two Galacticos, simply adding in a PS: \"I have not forgotten to speak of Beckham and Owen.

Anders Svensson and Matt Oakley are likely replacements with Kevin Phillips also scheduled to start, with Henri Camara rested.\\n\\n- Brentford boss Martin Allen: \"After conceding eight goals in our last three matches, I have to admit I\\'m not very confident. \"There\\'s no doubt we\\'re the underdogs and after defending so poorly recently it\\'s not looking good. \"Southampton have just drawn with the Premiership champions and that makes our task harder than it was already.\" \\n - Southampton boss Harry Redknapp: \"We know they can give us problems. \"Brentford have done well but we are the Premiership side and should have the better players. \"Staying in the Premiership is our priority.

They\\'re on their best run in the competition since reaching the quarter-finals for the fourth time in their history 16 years ago. Now they have the carrot of the plum draw in the last eight dangling before them. Victory over Premiership strugglers Southampton, would bring the mighty Manchester United to Griffin Park and a gigantic pay day for the sole League One survivors. \\n - Martin Allen\\'s brave side came back from two goals down at St Mary\\'s to earn a deserved replay. Southampton striker Henri Camara scored twice from close range to put the Saints in command, but Isaiah Rankin hit back just before half time, and Sam Sodje headed past a creaky defence on 58 minutes. \\n - The Londoners have conceded six goals in their two subsequent League outings - three each in losing away to Hartlepool and drawing at home to Sheffield Wednesday. But they haven\\'t lost in six League and Cup games on home turf - winning three and drawing three since the reverse to Torquay on Boxing Day. \\n - SOUTHAMPTON go into this tie on the back of an eventful Premiership match with Arsenal on Saturday. An angry David Prutton pushed referee Alan Wiley after being shown the red card, but his side still came back to draw 1-1. It was Saints\\' fourth stalemate in succession in all competitions, but didn\\'t lift them out of the relegation zone. The retention of their ever present Premier League status must be the number one priority, irrespective of the rewards that success against Brentford would bring. \\n - Victory here would set up a repeat of the 1976 final, when Saints astounded the football world by defeating Tommy Docherty\\'s Manchester United courtesy of Bobby Stokes\\' famous winner. They also knocked out the Red Devils in 1991 on penalties in the fourth round. But to write another chapter in their FA Cup history, the Solent side must avoid succumbing to lower division opposition for the first time since Rotherham, from the second level, beat them 2-1 in a third round tie at Millmoor on 16 January 2002. Southampton were last humbled by a club from the third tier six years ago. Fulham were then in the Second Division, when they won a third round replay at Craven Cottage 1-0 on 13 January 1999. \\n - To get to within two matches of a second visit to the Millennium Stadium in three years for the final, Harry Redknapp must guide his side past a club 36 places inferior on the League ladder, and a manager 19 years his junior, who played under him at West Ham.

Uefa explained that the move \"follows comprehensive studies into the sporting and medical aspects of using artificial playing surfaces.\" They can be used subject to complying with Uefa quality criteria but there use will not be made obligatory.

They are one of the major clubs in Europe and the pressure will be on Barcelona.\" Chelsea have not played Barcelona since that quarter-final tie five years ago. The Blues had looked destined to progress after winning the first leg at Stamford Bridge 3-1, courtesy of two goals from Tore Andre Flo and one by Gianfranco Zola. But they collapsed in the second leg, going down to strikes from Rivaldo (2), Luis Figo, Dani and Patrick Kluivert.\\n\\nFormer Chelsea captain Desailly, who is now playing for Al-Gharafa in Qatar, says there is no comparison between that side and the current Blues team, who are top of the Premiership. \"Mentally they are much stronger, even though a lot of their players are young,\" the 36-year-old said. \"We made some mistakes at the Nou Camp in 2000 - a lot of them were individual mistakes. \"It would not happen now. This team has a new motivation and a different mentality.\" World Cup winner Desailly saw huge changes during his time at Stamford Bridge. He was signed for £4.6m from AC Milan in 1998 by Ruud Gullit and went on to play under Gianluca Vialli and Claudio Ranieri. But the biggest change occurred when billionaire Roman Abramovich bought the club in 2003. Desailly says the Russian\\'s arrival helped to instil a winning mentality at the club as well as a demand for success. \"The whole of Chelsea is different now - the chairman, the manager and all the players,\" he said.\\n\\n\"Everything is new and there is a huge determination to win. \"Since that game in 2000, Chelsea have gained more experience in Europe and were very close to reaching the Champions League final last season.\" Desailly is one of the most decorated players in the history of football. He won the 1998 World Cup and 2000 European Championship with France, the Champions League in 1993 with Marseilles and 1994 with AC Milan, two Serie A titles and the FA Cup in 2000 with Chelsea.\\n\\nHe is now winding down his career in Qatar, alongside the likes of Frank Lebeouf, Josep Guardiola, Titi Camara, Gabriel Batistuta and Christophe Dugarry.

But they\\'ve not been beaten in the competition by a club outside the Premiership for nine years, since Ipswich - then in the second tier - defeated them 0-1 after extra time in a third round replay at Ewood Park on 16 January 1996. History is on Rovers side. When they last met their near neighbours in the FA Cup 45 years ago, it also required an Ewood Park replay, which the home side won 2-0, and when they last met in the League, Rovers did the double. They first won their Nationwide Division One trip to Turf Moor 0-2 four seasons ago, and then thrashed the Clarets on home soil 5-0. \\n - Manager Mark Hughes, who won the Cup four times as a player, is aiming to steer Rovers into the quarter-finals for the second time in 12 years, and first time since the 2000/2001 season. Success here, and victory home to Leicester in the next round, could see Rovers in the semi-finals without having played Premiership opposition. \\n - BURNLEY make the eight mile journey to their fierce rivals, determined to send Blackburn the same way as Liverpool in the third round. But having failed to pull off another shock at Turf Moor, it could be that the Championship outfit - 17 places inferior on the League ladder - have missed their best opportunity. Having said that, Burnley are yet to concede a goal in this Cup run. \\n - Steve Cotterills\\' Clarets have been knocked out in the fifth round four times in the last seven years, and have made only one appearance in the sixth round in 21 years. That was in the season before last, when they disposed of Premiership Fulham at this fifth round stage. \\n - While Blackburn have not played since the fifth round tie, Burnley have had two League outings away from home, drawing 1-1 at Derby and losing 1-0 at Preston. That takes their winless run to four games. The combatants from one-time prosperous mill towns, are both founder members of the Football League.
